</p>
<p>
My last three weeks of experience on Nagaland roads have been miserable and frustrating, to say the least. Because of the potholes and bumpy road conditions, my second-hand car has broken down again. But there’s another far more serious problem I’m currently struggling with, namely, the traffic congestion in Kohima. </p>
<p>

What about you? Have you ever thought about the economic costs traffic congestion has on us? Is there not a way to save our costs on fuel as well as our precious time on the road? </p>
<p>

First are the private costs of driving: fuel, oil, vehicular wear and tear, and the value of the driver’s time. These are all borne by the driver, in addition to the excise taxes on fuel and automobile licensing fees, which he must pay toward the costs of maintaining and policing the road system. Then, there’s another driving cost that is not borne by the individuals responsible for it---that is, the traffic congestion cost. </p>
<p>

On any road, after traffic volume reaches a certain point, additional vehicles entering the road slow the flow of traffic. Once this process of congestion occurs, every additional vehicle slows the traffic even more. Eventually, traffic comes to a complete halt. Under these circumstances, each driver is implicitly using, without paying for it, a valuable resource that belongs to other people---the time of other drivers and their passengers. All these problems not only create huge economic loss, but also trap human resources inside the vehicles as well as create more air pollution from gas emission.  </p>
<p>

Now, why do economists worry about traffic congestion?  Because its existence raises the possibility that people using the road could actually be better off if they were charged a money price (toll charge) for using the road. When this toll charge is imposed, several things can happen: First, this would discourage many drivers from using the road unnecessarily. Second, more people would begin to carpool and use public transit to avoid paying toll charges. And, still others might telecommute rather than come into the office at all. As a result, the reduced driving would reduce congestion and so conserve the valuable time of those who must be on the road. In fact, even by charging drivers a fee or a toll to drive on a road, more people can succeed in reaching their destination in any given time period because road tolls can both improve traffic flow and make drivers better off, let alone avoiding potential road rage. </p>
<p>

During my last 27-year stay in the United States of America, I have witnessed the numbers of cars on their road increased exponentially and saw how their politicians have always tried to stay ahead of their traffic problems by constructing more roads and/or continually widening them, building thousands of overbridges (flyovers) to avoid vehicles from slowing speed at road intersections, and building 10-lane tollways with dividers in between so that many vehicles can cruise at one uninterrupted speed. Of course, every car using tollways must have a small electronic device called a transporter installed on the front glass. The transporter transmits identifying information to receivers at the toll stations, which are suspended above the roadways. This is how charges for using the tollways are electronically registered and billed to each driver at the end of the month. Furthermore, along the stretches of multilane roads in America, specified lanes are designated as high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes. These are limited-access express lanes that provide zero- or reduced-price access to those who carpool. If the high-occupancy requirement is met, a driver can expect to travel at the speed limit even when traffic in adjacent lanes is bogged down during rush hour. The results of all these have been reduced congestion and improved economic efficiency---that is, drivers are better off, and local governments get extra revenue to spend on other services. </p>
<p>

In Japan, all of their 4,350 mile-long national highways are tollways. The nation began building the expressways in 1956 with loans from the World Bank so they imposed toll charges to pay off the loans. Yes, their loans were paid off already a long time ago, but the toll charges are still being collected to pay for many other public work projects. </p>
<p>

So, is there anything we can learn from all these examples mentioned above? I believe there is. With this confidence and thoughts in mind, I’d like to share a few ideas as to how we Nagas can also solve our traffic congestion problem in Kohima. </p>
<p>

Let us, for example, think of a solution from P.R. Hill to TCP Gate. First, we can widen this portion of our main road by constructing concrete retaining walls on the upper side of the road. These retaining walls must be so solid and strong so as to prevent landslide. Second, we have to have a big enough underground drainage system running throughout the length of the road so that we can use every available space on the top as part of the road. Third, we could build a double-layer road made out of 8-inch thick concrete cement blocks. As for the upper level road, it has to be made out of precast concrete segments supported by piers, columns, and other strengthening devices. This upper level road could be turned into a tollway for lighter vehicles, whereas the lower level road could be used for heavy vehicles. Flyover bridges could be built at P.R. Hill and TCP Gate so that exiting and/or entering vehicles wouldn’t  have to slowdown or halt anywhere once on the main road. In addition, no vehicle should be allowed to be parked on the main road. After all, public roads should never be turned into a private parking area. As for public parking in the P.R. Hill, the lake area could be turned into a multi-level parking building and do so for a fee, based on the duration of time each car is parked. </p>
<p>

Next, we could focus on doing the same things (as mentioned above) from TCP Gate to the High School Junction. Then, we can move on to develop the road from P.R. Hillto the Assam Rifle Gate at Lierie, which is on the way to Imphal, and lastly, from TCP Gate to the Kohima Civil Hospital. </p>
<p>

There are three other organizational methods to reduce our traffic congestion. The first is the use the public transport system or carpooling in place of each person driving a car on the same road. Another possible solution is this: the government could come up with a work-schedule which would allow some public workers to come to their workplaces early in the morning and others would come two hours later so as to avoid creating a peak traffic hour. Or lastly, the government could adopt a decentralized working system and equip its workers to move more toward telecommuting rather than coming into offices all at the same time. </p>
<p>

All these time-tested methods, when put together, can greatly reduce our traffic congestion problem in Kohima, thereby reducing our expenses on fuel, saving our precious time on the road, and allowing us to be more productive. </p>
