		<p id="heading">Our Big Fat Government Needs to Loose Weight
</p>
<p>

Our government is like a big fat person who only exists to eat. It depends on outside provision to survive as it is unable to support itself, let alone feed its own family. Our politicians, past and present, have made it this way by expanding the size of our government. They do this by simply adding more government posts every now and then. And of course, when the government gets bigger, the biggest beneficiaries are the politicians and the bureaucrats, not the private sector population.   </p>
<p>


Unfortunately, many of our young people also want to be added to the already big, fat, and bloated body of our government. They want government jobs or, more accurately, “government posts” as many are really after positions that come with privileges rather than seeking for sacrificial public services. And all this leads us down the path of draining up our economy instead of growing it. 
</p>
<p>

There are two main reasons why a big government is not conducive to economic growth. First, a big government simply consumes more. Hence, the bigger it becomes, the more it eats. Second, economy does not grow because of government. Often demand-oriented politics ends in promoting dependency on the government. And as bureaucracy grows, the employment market gets more stratified and the public becomes jaded and pressures mount on government for further expansion. This creates a vicious cycle that erodes the creative forces of free enterprise. On the other hand, when free people are encouraged to take responsibility to undertake any work they like, they become willing to take risks and to transform ideas into products and services. In other words, free enterprise spurs economic growth which in turn creates employment and vice versa. </p>
<p>


To grow our economy, the government must eat less and exercise more. It must get rid of all unwanted fat and obesity. Indeed, it must loose weight. In other words, our government bureaucracy needs to be downsized. Here are four suggested ways: </p>
<ol class="c">
 <li>
  <span id="sidehead">Recruitment Freeze.</span> We must cut our government workforce (say, by 15%) in the forms of freeze on new recruitment, abolition of vacant posts, and voluntary/compulsory retirement. This could save hundreds of crores each year in the public sector, with pay bills, including pensions. As it is, approximately 6000 government employees had gone on retirement which included about 1000 gazetted officers since November 1, 2009. This is a good start and more should follow. 
</br>


The government should not turn itself into a big employment house. It is never a good employer—it does poorly at choosing the right employees and performs miserably in supervision. So when it gets into the business of providing employment, it does more disservice to the public in the long run. For example, an average employee earning a salary of Rs. 13,000 per month would eat up approximately 5.5 million rupees (Rs. 5,460,000) over a period of 35 years, plus several lakhs on pensions. Now if the government could use the same amount to invest in the private sector, it could certainly lead to the creation of so many jobs as well as help to grow our private sector economy. This is just simple economics.
</li>
</br>
<li>

 <span id="sidehead">Termination:</span> The government must not tolerate habitual absences, tardiness and job efficiencies. It must adopt a policy of “the survival of the fittest.” Only those employees who can fulfill their job descriptions and produce more than they take out deserve job security. Others who lag behind become a government liability as their knowledge gets outdated, their skills become obsolete, and their competitive edge turns dull. We must eliminate all outdated positions and have workers reshuffled or transferred. We must cut off programs that do not work anymore. And we could do this with an incremental approach by means of reducing budgets in small percentages of all targeted agencies across the board and cutting the budgets of less important agencies by larger amounts. All these require strong political leadership. </li>
</br>
<li>
 <span id="sidehead">Devolution:</span> This refers to the policy of delegating public services and political power from one level of government and passing them down to a lower level of government, such as from state level and local level. The main benefits of devolution are as follows: (i) moving government employees closer to the clients can make government services more efficient and flexible, (ii) it can increase the sense of community ownership and responsibility, and (iii) all these can provide better accountability and reduce the chances for corruption.
 </br>

Perhaps the communitisation program of Nagaland may be considered as having some features of devolution. At least it is attempting to get the people in the various communities to run and manage some government services. But this experiment is far from sharing political power. As it is, many of our politicians have introduced partisan politics into our villages and have caused more divisions even among members of the same communities. They have also purchased many village leaders who can do their biddings. They hold the purse and control what a community can or cannot get. This is how some politicians use their power so they can have the communities in their hands. As such, our villages have become overly dependent upon the government for everything. 
This must change.
</br>

Rather than growing a bigger government, we must grow our villages and communities—that is, the government must decentralize the governance and empower the villages to function more like mini-governments, having policy-making and executive powers. We must restore our traditional system of the village republic ((“ura uvie” in Tenyidie) so self-rule can begin again. As in olden days, our community leaders must be chosen (not elected) based on their strength of character, depth of wisdom and, in keeping with modern day needs, breadth of knowledge. These people must be capable of getting their respective communities to the top—progressive and prosperous. And the salaries of these community leaders could be borne by the state government. Besides, the state government could come up with a fair system of sharing the public funds among the local communities so that they may be empowered to run their local-level governments. If this could happen, no village would be left out or left behind just because it does not have political connection or lobbying power. 
</br>

The government would do better when it serves as a partner, catalyst and facilitator for development rather than acting as a direct provider of growth; it must focus on suggesting ideas and formulating general guidelines rather than simply passing down policies from the top. The leaders of the communities know better about their own needs and how to fix their own problems. Indeed, they must be real leaders again within the jurisdiction of their village communities. </li>
</br>
<li>


<span id="sidehead">Privatization:</span> This means contracting out government services and goods to the private sector which should operate under some form of government supervision. It refers to removing all or part of a program from the public sector and passing it on to the private sector. There are four advantages to privatization: (i) It will save a lot of public funds in the sense that those in the private sector can provide the same services at lower pay and there will be no more government expenses on employees’ pensions, office buildings and administrative overheads; (ii) taking responsibilities and funds from the public sector to the private sector will speed up the growth of our economy as privatization will create competition, innovation, efficiency, and better quality of services; (iii) when the private sector is empowered, it will create labor demands which means more job opportunities, and (iv) all these will result in having our citizens to be less concerned about what the government can do for them and become more anxious about what they can do for their nation.
