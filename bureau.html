		<p id=heading>                                       Bureaucracy Reform</p>
<p id="sidehead">
Our Bureaucracy is Outdated and Inefficient</p>
<p>
We cannot keep using the traditional system of public management which is characterized by strict adherence to rules and regulations prescribed by a central authority in Delhi. Headquarters don’t understand problems. Their public works manual framed during the colonial regime are no longer suited to meet the needs of the 21st century. </p>
<p>

What we need to do is to change the system and re-design it and bring it in par with modern management practices.  We need to simplify rules and regulations, processes and procedures. For examples, a form that may require 17 steps could be streamlined to 4-step computer-based procedure in just 15 minutes.  Simply put:  we need to reinvent the way government operates. 

</p>
<p id="sidehead">

Our Bureaucracy is Over-Bloated and Overweight</p>
<p>

Our bureaucracy has grown overweight and over- bloated.  Despite being a very small State, Nagaland employs around 140,000 government employees, including those who are on work-charged and fixed pays. And all these public employees eat up almost 70 percent of our State budget just on salaries alone. </p>
<p>

To turn the bureaucracy from a being a liability to becoming an asset, we must do the following: 
</p>
<ul class="a"><li>

	Cut down the size of bureaucracy to the appropriate level. We must instruct all executive agencies not to replace the employees who are retiring.  Or more specifically, we must cut our government workforce (say, by 15%) in the forms of freeze on new recruitment, abolition of vacant posts, and voluntary/compulsory retirement.
</li></br><li>
	Contract out certain public services and privatize (see the attached published articles) </li></ul>
<p>

Our Bureaucracy is No More a People’s Institution</p>
<p>
Our bureaucracy is no longer able to serve the people it was designed to serve. It has come to exist for the political and bureaucratic class, resulting in one layer on top of another.  Over the years, the public servants have developed an unholy nexus with their political masters. By doing so, they believe they can enjoy life-long employment, guaranteed promotion, etc. They are more interested in exercising power and securing privileges which the public services offer. Bluntly put, our bureaucracy has become a place for self-service, not civil service. 
</p>
<p>
We must demand of public servants to listen to the people and truly serve by:</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>
	<span id="sidehead">Public Reporting</span>- Treat every member of people as citizen-owners of their government by readily and visibly communicating our progress in making government more efficient and cost-effective. 
</li></br><li>
<span id="sidehead">	Citizen Feedback </span>- Solicit and utilize feedback from citizens on government services and agency policies. 
</li></br><li>

	<span id="sidehead">Reforms</span>- eliminate waste and duplication, improve service delivery, remove the existing departmental silos to encourage sharing of what we learn across agency lines. 
</li></br><li>
	
	<span id="sidehead">Analysis</span> - Define each program’s performance objectives, identify and evaluate the resources available to meet them and establish objective metrics to measure the cost and value of operations. 
</li></br><li>
	
	<span id="sidehead">Accountability </span>- Establish an efficient governmental system that holds all employees accountable for their success or failure in meeting performance objectives — with real consequences in either case. We have all the technology that we need to engage our citizens in the process of governance—and put pressure on the political system. Specifically, every week we will ask citizens to take out their smartphones. We will ask them to answer some simple questions like: “What are public servants in your community doing for you? Do you think that we ought to be able to fire certain employees who fail to do their jobs?” 
</li></br></ul>
<p id="sidehead">

We Cannot Afford to Tolerate Incompetence 
</p>
<p>
We must ensure that the government moves to a meritocracy. In a seniority system—which is what we currently have in the government—you are paid for time in grade. You are not paid for performance. Over time, that means that people who are trying to do a good job get discouraged. We will eliminate the seniority system and move to a pay-for-performance model. </p>
<p id="sidehead">

What Other New Changes to Be Expected?
</p>
<ol class="a"><li>
•	Ban the current “Araam Work Culture” and introduce a rule of “full-pay for full-time work.”  
</li></br><li>
Approve a day light saving by introducing 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM as the new office hours (people are fresher and more productive in the morning). </li></br><li>
•	
Discontinue old working methods: using the fire-fighting mode of operation and drifting through the day without any clear focus. </li></br><li>
•	
Adopt new working methods:  Quality service and productivity numbers have to be everything. </li></br></ol>
