</p>
<p>
According to a recent report, the approximate numbers of government employees in some of our North-Eastern states of India are as follows: Manipur - 65,000; Meghalaya - 55,000; Arunachal - 45,000; Sikkim - 35,000; and Mizoram - 75,000.  But when it comes to the state of Nagaland, the number of government employees jumps to a whopping figure of 1,40,000, including those who are on work-charged and fixed pays.  This is the doing of our politicians who seem to believe in growing a big government when in fact it has become the “animal” that eats up our economic pie. For example, we spent Rs. 3119.73 crore on the salaries of our government employees alone in the last financial year 2013-2014, which was 60 percent of our state budget and that, too, was far above the 35 percent limit set by the 13th Financial Commission. </p>
<p>

If we were to have the luxury of Rs. 3119.73 crore to spend for Nagaland in any way we like for a year, what would we do differently?  First of all, we might want to make sure that the contribution of every one of those 1,40,000 government employees is worth more than the salary he or she gets. Otherwise, an under-performing employee is only a liability to the State. Unfortunately, our failure to this in problem has created more employee-related problems. For instance, today a large number of our so-called “public servants” are simply sitting idle, working at half speed or barely working. They come late to office and leave early. Those who work are often doing things not worth doing, following regulations that are outdated, and filling out forms that should not have been written. Instead of doing their part to enable the government to serve well, they seem to view their government as having an unlimited supply of resources and benefits which are not contingent on their hard work. Thus, many of our government employees have added to our woes rather than being part of the solution. </p>
<p>

Perhaps, the second thing we would do differently is to grow private businesses. Now let’s explain this statement in greater detail. Most economists contend that public agencies are generally less efficient than private business. The reason is not that lazy and incompetent workers somehow end up in the public sector while ambitious and capable people gravitate to the private sector. Rather, it is that the market system creates incentives and pressures for internal efficiency that are absent in the public sector.  </p>
<p>

Private enterprises have a clear goal---profit. Since private businesses often operate in highly competitive market, they are very committed to efficient management of the resources at hand. The question they are constantly asking is, How can we lower our costs and increase our profit margins? Often the answer is found in hiring only the most competent persons for the jobs and making the most out of them. Of course, the higher profit not only benefits the business owners but also enhances the promotion prospects of the employees. Moreover, part of the employees’ pay may be tied to profit via profit-sharing plans, bonuses, and stock options. In contrast, there are no similar financial incentives for government employees. As such, they are less driven or motivated to achieve efficiency. </p>
<p>

The market system imposes a very obvious test of performance on private companies: the test of profit or loss. An efficient business survives competition, grows, and prospers---that is, it is successful and therefore profitable. But an inefficient business in the private sector is forced to exit the market because it cannot generate profit. Or even if the entire business is not closed, certain corrective measures are usually taken, say, lay off under-performing workers, discontinue profitable activities, or stop production of failed products. </p>
<p>

In sharp contrast, there is no similar, clear-cut test in the government sector to assess efficiency of public agencies.  In the absence of market competition, for example, how can anyone determine whether a public hydroelectric provider, a state university, a local fire department, or the Department of Agriculture is operating efficiently?  In fact, the typical response of the government to a program’s failure is to increase its budget or add more employees. This means that public sector inefficiency just continues on a larger scale. There is also tendency for government bureaucrats to justify their continued employment by looking for new problems to solve. Therefore, it is not surprising that social “problems,” as defined by government, tend to persist or even expand. Furthermore, government employees, together with the special-interest groups they serve, may gain sufficient political clout to stop the elimination of their activities or programs. All these can get very complicated and problematic especially in programs relating to defense, education, health and welfare, and agriculture. Or sometimes inefficiency may persist because government is weighed down by rent-seeking, pressures by special-interest groups, short-sighted political vision, or limited choices. Or the fault could lie with the public, too. In a democratic system, sometimes the majority’s preferences for goods or services may be counterproductive---that is, projects having greater total benefits than total costs may be rejected, and projects having greater total costs than total benefits may be approved. </p>
<p>

Of course, the market system in the private sector is far from perfect. The above comparison is not between a perfect market system and an imperfect government, but between two inevitably imperfect institutions. Because of this reality, it is often difficult to determine whether a particular activity can be performed with greater success in the private sector or in the public sector. For example, what about operating the transport system, collecting garbage, maintaining parks and recreation, constructing housing, or providing education? This is to say that it is hard to determine with absolutely clarity whether certain services or programs should be assigned to either the public sector or the private sector, or to both. </p>
<p>

So, what’s the point we’re trying to make? It’s simply this: the government should be only as big as the private sector requires. For instance, if only 70,001 government employees are needed to function optimally for the 20 lakh people in Nagaland, then that is the number of employees we can afford to keep. Period. </p>
<p>

A government is a public agency---a means to serve for the interest of the people in the most effective and efficient way possible. Its economic function is to correct the shortcomings of the market system in the private sector. And it does this by enforcing rule of law, protecting private property rights, creating a market friendly atmosphere, and providing acceptable infrastructure so that everyone can have a higher standard of living.
