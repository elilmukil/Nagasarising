<p id="heading">                              Criminal Justice System Reform</p>
<p id="sidehead">

The Problems We Are In:  </p>
<p>
Our Criminal Justice System is broken. People are experiencing a daily ugliness that dashes hope and leaves only the fatigue of despair. </p>
<p>

First, we have widespread extortions and lawlessness of all kinds taking place for far too long in in the name of sovereignty even when, in fact, they have nothing to do with sovereignty anymore.  Can those who threaten our civilians at gun point be really considered “our” national workers?  Can those who do criminal acts go scot-free just because they are part of a Naga Political Group? </p>
<p>

Then, we have too many corrupt politicians who live off the public and loot crores of rupees meant for the ordinary people. But both our law enforcers and the public are always ready to overlook their crimes. Just imagine: What if a poor villager were to steal even 1% of the amount of what a powerful politician steals?   He would be beaten black and blue and then thrown behind bars. He’s treated very differently just because he happens to be a poor, defenseless person from a small village. </p>
<p id="box">

“When corrupt individuals get away with their bad deeds without being punished, this encourages other greedy people to go along with this new social norm (and for those who might prefer to cooperate who now feel the need to compete in the rigged system). A runaway pattern ensues whereby many people ‘defect’ from being good citizens and the corruption becomes systemic”  --  Joe Brewer, Director of Cognitive Policy Works. </p>

What will We Do to Solve our Problems? 
</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>

	We must make our Judiciary independent and autonomous from the Executive Branch.</li></br><li>
	We will bring fairness and firmness to the Justice System. No criminal act committed by anyone---be it a politician, a bureaucrat,  or a national worker ---will be given a free-pass.  </li></br><li>
	We will lay out a plan to keep communities safe by using a system of paid-community policing.  </li></br><li>
	We will require a police force that is engaged in their communities and has the necessary resources and support. Police can build trust while also keep people safe through a focus on community outreach, putting officers right on the streets and investing in cutting edge crime-fighting technology. </li></br><li>
	We will focus on turning prisoners into productive citizens.  As first time, non-violent offenders, give them the opportunity to get the treatment they need rather than serving jail time. Individuals who commit non-violent, minor offenses should have access to non-monetary bail options – giving them a chance to reclaim their lives. But as for those with violent records, or who pose a threat to their communities, we will deal with them with the full force of the Law. </li></br><li>
	We will provide education and job training opportunities for inmates, so that upon release ex-offenders will have acquired the skills they need to find stable employment. Re-entering the workforce is a critical step for ex-offenders to reintegrate into their communities and lead productive lives. </li></br><li>
	The Courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties of the law. No one accused of a crime may be punished arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably without following a fair procedure as per established laws. 
</li></br></ul>
