Air Connectivity</p>
<p>

The axis of the global aviation industry is moving toward the Asia-Pacific region, surpassing both North America and Europe in terms of passenger numbers. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), about 7.3 billion airline passengers will be travelling globally by 2034, with a significant number of these passengers flying to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region. For that matter, India alone has already over 250 million people (individuals who make Rs.2 to 3 lakh annually) who can afford to travel at least within the country. </p>
<p>

Air connectivity drives tourism and economic growth; it generates activity and employment. With all these I mind, our government must do the following: </p>
<ul class="a"><li>

	Build a spacious airport of international standard.</li></br><li>
	Operate our own special aircraft through a public-private partnership</li></br><li>
	Ensure daily flights to and from Dimapur. </li></br></ul>

 </p>

             <div class="othertravelsparatext">   
<p id="sidehead">

Television and News Media. </p>
<p>

The government should view the fourth estate of democracy as serving the same cause as it does---serving on behalf of and for the welfare of the people. To that end, our government should reach out to the news media fraternity in the following ways: <ul class="a"><li>
	Support freedom of press so that journalists and media personnel can serve as watchdogs for society and hold public servants accountable. </li></br><li>
	Ensure physical security of media workers whenever necessary. </li></br><li>
	
	Provide certain rooms and/or facilities in government buildings. </li></br><li>
	
	Provide financial incentives for solving problems of government corruption. </li></br><li>
	
	Privatize TV services and create competition in the market. </li></br><li>

	Help create a regular media platform where journalists, opinion-makers, politicians, national workers and others can freely debate, critique, and interact with each other on any issue. </li></br><li>
	
	Help provide at least 4 local channels running 24 hours a day (news channel, sports channel, music channel, education program, children program, movie channel, etc.). </li></br></ul>

Internet Freedom
 </p>
<p>

Internet freedom has produced robust free speech for millions and is an incubator for entrepreneurs to expand jobs and opportunities. As such, the government must ensure Internet freedom by staying away from any form of Internet censorship

Computer Technology
 </p>
<p>

Today, more than 35% of the world has the Internet, creating an interconnected web of community which no national boundary can stop. Indeed, many of the young people born between 1980 and 2000 intuitively know how to use the Internet to gain information online and exchange ideas, which has the potential to foster innovation. 
 </p><ul class="a"><li>
	We must ensure 24/7 Internet connectivity. </li></br><li>
	We must require every high-school student, and above, to have a personal computer, which has become a must-have tool for education. </li></br><li>
	We must empower our 21st century generation with access to latest technology. We must work toward getting high-speed Internet access combined with microcomputers in their hands as soon as they become available in the market. </li></br></ul>
