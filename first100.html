<p>
Our new leadership must get to work immediately to bring change. The first 20 things to address within the first 100 days in public service could be as follows: 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:25px;">

      <u>  Reverse Wrongs Policies, Practices and Programs of the Past Government</u>
</p>
<ol class="c"><li>
	Abolish the current culture of “Chief Guests,” which promotes pressure-based donations. Under this Law, any public official who donates any amount of public funds without going through a proper evaluation process will be doing so only at his or her own risk. </li></br><li>
	Abolish the culture of advertising politicians on any completed project or monument (e.g., no more of “Inaugurated by the Hon’ Minister ….”)</li></br><li>
	Dramatically cut down the number of vehicles of our politicians’ convoys. </li></br><li>
	Drastically cut down the number of Parliamentary Secretary positions. </li></br><li>
	Put a temporary ban on all new government hiring and regularization of all ad hoc services. </li></br><li>
	Ban the practice of deduction or collection of commissions by politicians and bureaucrats. </li></br><li>
	Approve the public demand of “One government One Tax” throughout the State of Nagaland. </li></br><li>
	Make any act of nepotism by politicians (e.g., awarding contracts or appointments to favor their immediate kith and kin more than others) illegal and thus punishable by law. </li></br><li>
	Repeal the failed Total Liquor Prohibition Law and replace it with an incrementally tightening approach, “Liquor Restriction  Law,” which will be more manageable. To start with:  payment of high taxes on sale of liquor (55%), imprisonment and heavy fines (or seizure of vehicles used) for illegal transportation, fines for liquor sale to minors, fines for public drunkenness, and fines for driving under alcohol influence. </li></br><li>
	Ban the current “Araam Work Culture” and introduce a rule of “full-pay for full-time work.”  </li></ol>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:25px;">

                      <u> Adopt New Legislations and New Bills</u></p>
<ol class="c"><li>
	Approve the Lokayukta Act to investigate and report corruption in the Government and to redress public grievances. </li></br><li>
	Approve the creation of making the Judiciary to be autonomous and independent from the Executive Branch. </li></br><li>
	Approve the Supreme Court Order on the implementation of 33 percent quota for women in municipal and town councils for 10 years (but could be revisited if women fail to step forward) </li></br><li>
	Approve an institution of a Council of Advisors (somewhat similar to the House of Councilors in the Japanese Parliamentary system of government), with one representative from each tribe. </li></br><li>
	Approve allotment of two prime locations as Free Nagas’ Community Centers for Eastern Nagaland peoples. (one in Kohima District, another one in Dimapur District) </li></br><li>
	Impose term limits on how many times a politician is allowed to seek re-election (e.g., for the Chief Ministerial position, 10 years; for all other Legislative positions, 20 years). </li></br><li>
	Approve the creation of a two new positions: “Deputy Chief Minister” and “Economic Ambassador” </li></br><li>
	Approve a day light saving by introducing 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM as the new office hours (people are fresher and more productive in the morning). </li></br><li>
	Approve any act of discrimination along the line of “tribe” as a hate crime against the Naga family. No one should be left out or left behind because he or she belongs to a certain “tribe.”  We must do everything possible to restore our unity and equality. Also, there should be proportional distribution of public goods and/or resources based on the size of population. </li></br><li>
	Approve a ceremony of dedication of our leaders to public service and a celebration of a new era (a great historical event of spectacular parade and celebration, to be organized and led by young generation Nagas). </li></ol>
