<p id="heading">	                           Eliminating Deficit and Bad Debts</p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Problems:</span> Our politicians, past and present, have caused our government’s deficit to reach over Rs.14 crores. Their squandering of public money has caused development to suffer. Their out-of-control spending habit is a debt burden to be borne by our children. Because the debt has gone up, government’s capability to create job has gone down, too. But they don’t do anything to fix the problems. This is not only irresponsible, but immoral and unjust to present and future generations. </p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Solutions:</span> The fiscal crisis that faces our people must be taken seriously and immediately addressed. A complete and thorough audit of the government spending will finally allow the Naga public people to know exactly how their money is being spent by our politicians and bureaucrats. The people have a right to know what their government is doing with public money. We must fight to audit every government spending and restore transparency and fiscal sanity for the people. </p>
<p>

It’s time for bold action: we must hold our politicians accountable. We must demand our politician to shrink our debt burden.  We must pay down the debt and balance the budget. </p>
<p>

How will we do that? </p>
<ul class="a"><li>
	We must close all government loopholes and wasteful expenditures. </li></br><li>
	We will institutes a Commission to assess government spending levels. We will appoint private-sector leaders to serve on the Commission that would ensure government accountability. </li></br><li>
	We will move all Departments and/or Agencies to zero-based budgeting and require every Agency to justify every rupee that they spend so that all public money is efficiently utilized and properly accounted. </li></br><li>
	We will give every one of our citizens a private account so that money meant for them (public money) will be transferred directly into their accounts. </li></br><li>
	Instead of creating financial burden on the public, the bureaucracy should help toward increasing the wealth of every citizen of ours.</li></br></ul>
