Given the unique challenges of our geography, perhaps no other country has a deeper need for reliable and high quality infrastructure than Nagaland.  From spacious airport and multiple railway links, to all-weathered roads and proper drainage system, flyovers and tunnels, and 24/7 water availability and power supply … all these provisions are needed to enable local businesses to grow and expand. In the absence of these infrastructures, no nation can prosper. Even a simple problem like small road causes traffic congestion. And the problems arising from traffic delays can easily become more costly than the cost of building bigger and better roads over a period of time.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the last two successive governments have completely ignored the development of our State’s infrastructure. It’s now time we seriously take up these challenges and lay the economic foundations of our people by enforcing the Law of Imminent Domain, the inherent right of the State to take private property for public use.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>The government may exercise people’s mandate to take private lands for public use.</li>
</br>
<li>It may use public funds to buy out private properties at current market value.</li>
</br>
<li>The burden of compliance to the Law of Imminent Domain must be placed on the entire community, and not on the individual land-owners. Also, the community must help relocate those private land-owners and provide them with reasonable compensations with help from the government.</li>
</br>
<li>	In case of obstruction of public welfare by any person, the government reserves the right to take away the individual’s access to any public resources (electricity, public transportation, government jobs, voting rights, etc.).  Bluntly put, land owners should come on board in the interest of the public or face consequences.</li>
 
</ul></div>

</p><p id="sidehead">                           What can the Government Provide for the Public
</p><p id="sidehead">
Reliable Power Supply</p><p>
In addition to the purchase of more electricity from other State(s), we must set up more hydro- and solar-power generation of our own. Although wind-energy generation can be very expensive, this is another area we must invest in in the distant future.  
</p><p id="sidehead">
24/7 Water Supply</p><p>
When rainy season lasts almost half of the year, there is no reason why our people should be undergoing water shortages. We can, and must, solve water crisis once for all. In Kohima, we can ensure 24/7 clean water availability to every home within 5 years; in Dimapur, within 7 years, and so on. </p>

<p id="sidehead">

All Weathered Roads</p><ul class="a"><li>
	No permanent road construction must be undertaken prior to construction of proper drainages. That is, drainages must be well-designed so as to prevent soil erosion or potential landslides. More specifically, we must use soil entrapment by reinforcing roots of developing plants, control of rainfall impact by grass/plant blankets, gabions systems to reduce runoff velocities, bank stabilization, proper drainage system, and water discharge methods.</li></br><li>
	Superhighways like China’s National Truck Highway System must be developed. Tunnels and bridges must be built to cut distances and straighten roadways; all curves must be properly aligned, asphalt surfacing must be added to concrete pavement to absorb vehicular noise; edgeline rumble strips on shoulders of the road to enhance safety or alert sleepy drivers. </li></br><li>
	A split highway could be created between Dimapur and Kohima. This could be built in paddy-field like layers (3 lanes for going down and 3 lanes for going up) in most areas rather than having a 4-lanes wide roadway throughout the entire stretches. The advantages for this design are as follows: (1) traffic will flow more smoothly, (2) it is more suitable to hilly landscape, (3) it is eco-friendly as less soil will be disturbed, and (4) will create a stunning view as trees will grow in between and on all sides.   </li></br><li>
	For development of a Greater Dimapur, we must build a ring road (beltline) in stages: 6 + 6 lanes, 15 miles (?) in length and 5 miles (?) in width. This beltline road must have concrete surfacing, toll booths, exits, no crossing or stop sign, etc. And it must be funded, maintained, and operated by private company through some contract agreement with the State government. </li></br><li>
	Flyovers must be built at intersections of major roads.  These structures must be solid, using piers, columns, and precast concrete segments. The benefits are as follows: (1) maximizing real estate, (2) better connectivity, and (3) easing traffic congestion or delays. </li></br><li>
	A sophisticated traffic control system must be developed with the following things in minds: traffic management, first responders, tow trucks, etc. 
</li></ul></div>

Bigger and Better Airport</p><p>
We must shift to a more spacious place and upgrade our airport to meet the international standards.
</p><p id="sidehead">
Railways</p><p>
We must introduce local train services. We must build railway lines wherever possible to connect one place to another. Railroads promise cheap, fast, and reliable transportation. For instance, it will allow farmers to ship goods to market faster and with less cost; it will open up many opportunities for railway-related businesses; and it will lead to new urban settlements at various junctions. In short, railroad boom will result in economic development, industrial growth, and new settlements. 
</p><p id="sidehead">
Parks and Recreation</p><p>
We must build pedestrian truss, aesthetic bridges, and greenway systems.

Infrastructural Development of Dimapur</p><p>
The government must acquire more private lands for nation-building purposes. More agricultural areas must be turned into residential lands. More public parks and forest reserves must be created. </p><p>
A new Dimapur City must be geometrically designed and scientifically developed in a new area. We must tap into the expertise of City planners, real estate developers, architects, and engineers from developed countries so as to build the City that meets all international standards. </p>
<ul class="a">
<li>
	All sub-standard houses and construction must be relocated or demolished. New laws for zero-tolerance of slum dwelling must be enacted.</li></br><li>
	The government must have the right to buy out existing properties at current market value, enforce easement rules, penalize encroachers, and exercise rights of Imminent Domain. </li></br><li>
	Detailed zoning ordinances and building codes must be formulated and enforced. </li></br><li>
	Drainage and sewer systems must be well-planned and built to cover the entire City. </li></br><li>
	Aggressive eco-friendly landscaping projects must be adopted all over the city. </li></br><li>
	House addresses must be developed; streets, named; directional signs, installed; and street lights, erected. </li></br><li>
	All electrical wirings to homes must be installed underground; cable and telephone wirings may be go underground; water pipelines must be directly connected to every house. Smart Meter technologies must be deployed to give customers a more precise picture of their overall energy consumption and water usage of these scarce resources. </li></br><li>
	Toilet in every home must be built; community waste disposal program, introduced; littering in public places, banned. </li></br><li>
	All residential areas must have easy access to exemplary schools, first-class hospitals, Post Offices, Police and Fire Stations. </li></ul>
