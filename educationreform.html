The Problems We are In: </p>
<p>
Even after 53 years of statehood, Nagaland has no tangible development in the education sector. There is no medical college, no engineering college, no regional institute, let alone a national one. As a result, our young people have no option but to go to other parts of India for further education and spend tens of crores of rupees outside. </p>
<p>

As for the ones we have, we are mismanaging them in every conceivable way.  “The Department of School Education (DoSE) has become a sick department mired in every conceivable form of corruption – nepotism, back door appointment, non-payment of salary, mid-day meal scam, non-function government schools, non- release of text books, bogus- proxy teachers ….” ( ACAUT, April, 2016) </p>

Doing Much More for Our Children: </p>
<ul class="a">
<li>

Ensure delivery of a high quality education to every child by making sure that every child gets a good teacher and a good school. </li></br><li>
 Modify our curriculum, adopt innovative education models, and unleash the creative spirit of our youngsters.  We should allow students to re-enroll at different colleges over time without losing credits so students have the flexibility to jump in and out of education as needed.</li></br><li> 
 We should also expand apprenticeships and training programs while linking employers with education institutions to offer a variety of paths for individuals to develop the skills the labor force needs. </li></br><li>
  Reward good teachers with additional bonuses for good performance. As for under-performing teachers, they must be replaced or their tenure shortened. 
</li></br><li>
  Students struggling in public schools for no fault of their own will be given the option of attending private schools without cost to their parents. 
</li></br><li>

  Make higher education more accessible for all. Ensure that every young person can affordably develop the skills they need to compete in the modern economy.
</li>
</br>
<li>
  Pass a school bill which will give the private community Christian schools legal parity with the government schools.  We will give government subsidy also to Christian schools so that parents who don’t want to send their children to government schools may have the option to send their children to Christian schools at partial government expense. In return, all such schools must demonstrate transparency and accountability.  Greater transparency will also allow schools to analyze and compare their operating costs with other similar institutions.
