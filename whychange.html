A new generation is taking over the helms of governments in many parts of the world. They are rising up against the misrule of the old generation leaders and speaking out against inefficient governments that are holding them back. They are taking upon themselves the responsibility, even at the risks of losing their lives, to bring about change. They see that their future is at stake, so they’re on a mission to take it back. 
</p><p>
In contrast, our Naga people are still in a deep political slumber, despite crisis upon crisis pilling over us. We don’t realize that our so-called leaders are eating our lunch while we are asleep. For them, it’s all about keeping their own chairs and building their own empires. Except for our votes and support, we are least on their minds. </p><p>

Yes, it’s time we wake up and take back our future.  </p></div>

Our Power Structures are Twisted </p><p>

Sometimes people will say, “The river is flowing.”   But I say, no, no, no, … river doesn’t flow.  It’s only the water in the river that flows. And when water in a river flows, it flows on the river bed. If the river bed is crooked and zigzag, the water flows crooked and zigzag.  If it is straight and smooth, the water flows straight and smooth.  </p><p>

Similarly, our socio- political structure in Nagaland has become twisted and crooked because of institutionalized corruption. Our politicians and their cronies have hijacked the State machinery and most civil societies to shore up power. Thanks to our corrupt politicians who have corrupted everything they have touched!  As leaders, they are responsible. But as far as the general public is concerned, they’re like the body of water flowing down in a river. </p>

Our Political System is Broken</p>
<p>
A person defines the “Democracy” in Nagaland as “the government off the people, force the people, and buy the people.”  </p><p>

Indeed, we are seeing a complete subversion of our democratic system in our State. Now, it’s just an oligarchy, where a handful of very wealthy people and special interests determine who gets elected or who doesn’t.  This cannot be in Nagaland, the land which was once well-known for “pure democracy.” </p><p>

During the campaign cycle, crores of rupees from the politicians flood into the hands of the masses to buy their votes. Then, they spend more public money buying candidates to form a majority party. Our leaders are out of control as far as doing things right is concerned. </p><p>

"ACAUT said any individual having more than two names in the E-Roll should be prosecuted and jailed as per the Representation of People's Act. It regretted that so far the State Election Commission has failed to apply the full force of the law"
</p>
<p>

It’s time we root out dirty money from the election campaign. This’s the only way we can elect the right leaders, even if they come from poor and humble backgrounds.

Ours is a “Do-Nothing Government” </p><p>

Sadly, our current governmental system no longer serves the people in Nagaland; rather, it serves itself.  As far as serving the people is concerned, it is doing nothing.  </p><p>

Our politicians are all talk, no action. Even when problems of inaction or wrong-doing are brought to their attention, they only resort to using tactics of more empty promises and sweet lip-services to deflate public pressure or delay solution. They don’t understand that the blame for the problems must end with them (accepting responsibility for the problems). </p><p>

Their only achievements are amassing personal wealth, growing their own Party bigger, and promoting Naga festivals.

<p><span id="sidehead">Our Politicians are Visionless.</span></p><p>All they do is simply borrowing Delhi’s vision and programs, whatever they may be. </p><p>

<i> “What have the state Government, present and past, done, or is doing, to make our people self-sufficient, self-reliant, stand on out two feet, etc., so that we wouldn't need to depend on the Central Government for sustenance? And first of all, we must be very clear that the Nagaland state Government implementing the Central flagship programmes do not count as the state Government's efforts and endeavours towards development in the state because it is merely doing what it has been asked to do and these Central flagship programmes are more or less fully funded by the Centre” --- Monalisa Changkija</i></p><p>

In recent years, our politicians have embraced NSCN (IM)’s vision of “shared-sovereignty” and are perfectly okay with throwing us under the “bus” of the IM and the Naga Hoho, while possibly hoping some shares in the booty for themselves.  And most recently, our Opposition-less Party leaders have started asking the public to help them with ideas about vision because they are plagued with total bankruptcy of original ideas. </p><p>

Because of these visionless leaders, we’re on the precipice. If we go on like this, continuing down the same pathway, we will have doomed our children and our grandchildren.

<p> <span id="sidehead">Neiphiu Rio:</span> Having witnessed first-hand the pathetic, underdeveloped conditions in Eastern Nagaland in two of my trips there, my reaction---as shared with the public in some of the Nagaland newspapers in 2011, was, “I’m really ashamed as an Angami, because this was nothing but a result of utter neglect under the leadership of an Angami leader, Neiphiu Rio.”</p>

<p> <span id="sidehead">Shürhozelie Liezietsu: </span> At an Angami leaders’ meeting in December of 2015 at Shürhozelie’s residence, I felt compelled to tell him: “Your NPF Party is responsible for luring in certain factions to create so much turmoil and fear in the lives of the people in Nagaland. … I wish you could still use your position as a leader to correct these situations you guys have already brought about.”</p>

<p> <span id="sidehead">Kiyaneilie Peseyie:</span>  Again, this is what I had to tell Kiyaneilie after a delicious dinner at his residence: “Thank you, Sir. …. But your NPF Party has had ample opportunities and funds to develop Nagaland and bring up our people, and yet it has failed miserably. So, I find your Party to be very, very disappointing.”</p>

Our corrupt politicians have created our corrupt political system. They live off the system to stay in power.  To maintain the status quo is their goal. So, they can’t be expected to bring any change because they are the system themselves. </p><p>

We must take Nagaland back. It’s time we return power to the people. Ours will be a citizen government again.  We will empower our communities for self-governance as in the days of our ancestors. We will put people first. We will restore the Naga honor and self-respect to all. 
</p><p>

To bring change, we must act now… not later. </p>
