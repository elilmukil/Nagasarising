</p>
<p>
<i>What does God say? </i></p>
<p>
	
“Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. 
They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck” (Prov. 1:8-9). </p>
<p>

<i>The Naga Experience</i></p>
<p>

Although my uncle  Sebi Dolie, now old and blind, would probably be embarrassed for his story to be shared in public, the stubborn part of me wanted to do it, because he represented the way of life our Naga ancestors lived. </p>
<p>

When Sebi was just a small boy, his father Goyie accidentally shot a friend. So, Goyie had to be punished according to Naga customary law—that is, he had to flee from his Khonoma village and be in exile for a period of seven years. As a family man, this necessitated him to take his family with him and sought refuge in Jotsoma village. 
<p>
</p>
After fully serving time in exile, the Dolie family returned home. There Sebi started life again, and after many years of hard work he became quite wealthy and well-established. But he realized that his attainment of wealth did not just happen in a vacuum—others in his community made it possible by being his supporters and clients. Knowing this fact, he did what every wealthy Naga would do in those days: shared his wealth with his community members.  <p>
</p>

Coming to modern time, he was presented with opportunities to make easy money. One of his old time friends, who later became a Chief Minister of Nagaland, once arranged a contract work of planting trees. Several months later, he was informed that he could go to a certain government office to collect the money. While appreciating his friend’s thoughtfulness, Sebi was shock and upset at how someone would encourage taking public money for a non-existent work.     <p>
</p>

Several years ago, he said to me, “In the olden days, our people were men of honor. They valued honest earning and honorable living. But this kind of honor is missing in our society today.” <p>
</p>

<i>Okay, so now what? </i><p>
</p>

Our Naga forefathers handed down to us a society that had no social class distinction, no servant, no beggar, no jobless person, no houseless person, no property ownerless family, no land tax, no liquor bar, no rape, no prostitution business, no corruption. Yes, they were men and women of honesty and honor. As such, they had no need of locked doors, police protection or prison system. <p>
</p>

Day 98:  Opportunistic Leaders Versus Principled Leaders<p>
</p>

<i>What does God say? </i>  <p>
</p>

“A greedy man brings trouble to his family, but he who hates bribes will live” (Prov. 15:27). <p>
</p>

<i>The Naga Experience</i><p>
</p>

The Nagas have never lacked leaders. Especially whenever political weather show chances for easy opportunities, many individuals emerge on the surface as leaders. These so-called leaders are really opportunists, having no political principles or vision. They are constantly blown around, depending on the political wind of the day. As early as 1930s, J. P. Mills, a former British civil servant, observed such kind and wrote that educated Nagas are spineless and without vision, only interested in a paid job. What a shame! <p>
</p>

Unlike these type of opportunistic leaders, A. Z. Phizo proved himself to be a man of principle and vision. All his political actions were driven by one deeply-rooted belief: Nagas are a free, independent people and therefore they must always exist that way as a nation. <p>
</p>

He considered himself a Free Naga. When the British offered him an opportunity to work with the British Engineers under the category of Anglo-Burmese or Anglo-Indian, Phizo was adamant that his nationality was Naga. As a consequence, he lost the opportunity. Then again, the British proposed to turn the North-East into a Crown colony, but Phizo opposed the idea. He reasoned, why should we give up our independence and become subjects to an alien power? <p>
</p>

The first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru tried his best to buy the Naga leader several times. In 1947, Nehru asked Phizo to become the Governor of Assam since Nagaland was then known as the Naga Hills District of Assam. When Phizo refused, Nehru asked if he would accept the Chief Ministerial position for the State of Assam. Even that Phizo declined. For the last time in 1952, Nehru asked the Naga leader to become the President of India. But again, Phizo did not budge even a bit. Having tried everything and failed, Nehru eventually became very frustrated with the Naga leader. This was why Nehru changed his strategy in dealing with the Naga people. On the one hand, he used the Indian army to threaten the Nagas into submission. On the other hand, he began luring some educated Naga opportunists with promise of power and positions within the setup of the Indian Union.  <p>
</p>

<i>Okay, so now what?</i>
</p><p>
Today, our Naga people are witnessing two very different kinds of leaders again. The first kind are opportunists, craving for a taste of political power and high positions for self-serving purposes. The second kind are people of principles and vision. More than anything else, they want a better future for us. So now, which kind of leaders would we rather have?
