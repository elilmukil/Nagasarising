<p>


Rural communities are often left behind. They often struggle to attract capital because of the lack of infrastructure and development. They have less access to quality doctors.  Schools have trouble recruiting teachers. Often they cannot get fair prices for their products and compete on the open market.
</p>
<p>

The rural quality of life in the nearly 1250 villages in Nagaland must be improved in keeping with the times. Here’s what we can do:  
</p>
<p id="sidehead">

Upgradation of Infrastructure</p>
<ul class="a"><li>

Ensure every rural community to have access to a modern communication infrastructure, such real time phone service and Internet access.
</li></br><li>	Build and maintain roads, bridges, water-reservoirs and water pipelines that rural communities need. </li></ul>

</p>
<p id="sidehead">


Restoration of Local Self-Government
</p>
<p>

We must make every village the common pride of every community. Just like in ancient times, we must restore self-rule and the people’s sovereignty within each village through a process of communitization and devolution of governmental power. </p>
<p>

<i>
Adopt the Chinese Model of Village Election: </i> (1) Promote local self-government at the village level, and (2) use a two-party system of village election for a healthy check-and-balance government.  But these two local-level parties should be strictly local-based, and not become an extension of any State-level political parties.  
</p>
<p>

The local level government may be called the “Village Development Authority” (VDA). Every village must be upgraded from the Village Panchayat/VDB system to a mini-legislative body, having policy-making and executive powers to ensure effective functioning and progressive development of the community: healthcare and welfare, education and awards, roads/streets and bridges, water and electricity, environment and natural resources, housing and land, dispute settlements, communication and community projects, law and order, recreation and parks, drainage and sewage, waste disposal and beautification, agriculture and business, etc. And every VDA must develop its own charter which will protect the democratic process and ensure a just administration. And it must come up with a five-year village development plan (to be approved by the people).     </p>
<p id="sidehead">


The VDA Members</p>
<ul class="a"><li>

	<i>Chief Village Overseer</i>: The village may elect one of its people as their Chief Village Overseer (or simply Village Chief) for a term of 5 years. The Village Chief must be accountable to the Village Development Board (VDB). He may also serve as the people representative to the State government. The CVO’s salary must be borne by the government. </li></br><li>
	<i>Clerk:</i> Registers and records documents such as deeds, mortgages, birth/death certificates; often runs village election; serves as secretary to VDA Board and clerk of local courts; manages postal services. </li></br><li>
	<i>Treasurer:</i> Keeps funds and financial records, makes payments for expenses. </li></br><li>
	<i>Law & Order Officer:</i> Provides protection, enforces policies, carries out local court orders, conducts criminal investigations, prosecutes criminal cases, collects fines/taxes, etc.</li></br><li>
	<i>School Superintendent:</i> Administers public elementary and secondary schools’ affairs. </li></br></ul>
<p id="sidehead">
Courts & Disputes
</p >
<p>
The village-level trial system must be developed and organized; customary laws must be documented and streamlined; past judgments must be recorded so they can be used as precedents to decide future cases. Fines for violations of community laws may be used as a revenue source. Cases that cannot be resolved at the village level may be taken to the next level courts (municipal courts or district courts).  </p>
<p id="sidehead">


Village Guards</p>
<p>

In keeping with our ancestral way of self-defense, every village must be given the right to defend itself from any anti-social element. The VDA may appoint its Village Guards to bear arms for the protection of its community. However, they must be properly trained by the State Police Force and be duly licensed by the government. The duties of the Village Guards can be as follows: enforce mandatory school attendance, ensure community peace, register complaints, keep out all illegal activities, implement zero-tolerance of public drunkenness, oversee community lock-up facility, and arrest criminals, including those who take the law into their own hands.   
</p>
<p id="sidehead">

Government Funding Policies </p><ul class="a"><li>
	People in the villages may be exempted from any form of government taxes. Instead, they could be given a 3% of the tax revenues from urban dwellers, in addition to government-grants and/or project developments for the community. </li></br><li>
	The VDA may collect an annual capitation fee (head count) from all its citizens: (1) as a means to keep its census record current, and (2) as a revenue source to support the most disadvantaged members of its community. </li></br><li>
	Any village community may present carefully thought-through written proposals at function(s) to which government officials may be invited. However, no government official will be empowered to promise any government funding on spot. Any proposal submitted for government funding has to be carefully scrutinized by appropriate committees and all decisions must be based on real needs, government priorities, and funding availability. </li></br><li>
	No community may invite public officials to public function with the motive of soliciting funds. Any government employee or politician receiving any gift or donation from the public must be firmly dealt with. </li></br><li>
	All government funds for village development must go directly to the VDA. This will avoid the misuse of a portion of fund by middlemen in government offices. </li></br><li> 
	All funding and/or contract works within a village area must pass through the appropriate VDA. The government must empower the VDA to enforce the standard(s) of work and/or quality of results to be produced on behalf of the general public.
</li></br></ul>
<p id="sidehead">
Village-Planning
</p>
<ul class="a"><li>
	<i>House addresses:</i> Every home must be assigned an address, every street must be named, and building codes must be enacted.</li></br><li>
	<i>Postal services to be introduced:</i> Mails, parcels, packages, plus items such as government rations/pensions for the elderly and the disabled must be delivered to where they are.  </li></br><li>
	<i>Public Sanitation:</i> Public places, streets and lavatories must be maintained. Laws of garbage disposal and littering must be enforced. No spitting in public places anywhere. No pig from pigpen should be visible from public streets or roads.  </li></br><li>
	<i>Ensure access to safe drinking water:</i> Restoration of natural springs, water conservation methods and water purification systems must be introduced. </li></br><li>
	<i>Buildings to be built:</i> VDA Office Building, Sports & Recreation Center, Library, etc. </li></br><li>
	<i>Growing Forests:</i> We must adopt a “Turn Green Program”: For every tree that is cut down, five new trees should be planted (similar to a government policy of Tanzania). This will help to preserve farmland, protect soil erosion, add pleasant climate, increase better health, provide aesthetic beauty to the village, save wildlife habitats, attract eco-tourists, and generate local revenue. And above all, more trees means more water. That is, water evaporates from the leaves of trees, and then falls as rain. If the trees are cut, less water will evaporate. As a result, less rain will fall. </li></br></ul>
	<p id="sidehead">

Self-Sustainability</p><ul class="a"><li>
<i>	Self-Sustainability Program:</i> Every family can become more self-sufficient by simply undertaking two projects: (1) Backyard Fishery Pond -- conserving water resource to grow “fish for food,” and (2) Miracle Garden -- utilizing available land space for rotational seeding and multiple harvesting by using worm composting (“Worms Eat My Garbage”), mulching, row cover, sticky barriers, and non-systemic pesticides.    </li></br><li>
Animal-rearing business to be encouraged (e.g., 1 male goat/3 female goats ratio). </li></br><li>
Open cooking fire must be replaced by inexpensive stoves solutions. This will result in 70% less wood, eliminate fire hazards, reduce respiratory illnesses, and save more trees. </li></br><li>
	Solar panels must supplement hydro-electricity. More energy will increase production and make life easier. Also, we must adopt a smart way to save energy by replacing regular light bulb with GE compact florescent light bulb. For example, the light output of a 23 watts florescent light bulb is equivalent to a 100 watts regular bulb. Saving energy means paying less on electric bills. </li></br></ul>
<p id="sidehead">

Business Development</p><ul class="a"><li>
	Corporate Banking system and financial literary programs must be introduced with a view to create additional revenue for the rural people. </li></br><li>
		Government must support small business development: provide micro-business loans or capital for farmers to create value-added enterprises like farmer-owned processing plants and cooperative marketing initiatives such as small-scale industries, home-based businesses, and other micro-enterprise initiatives. Government to provide micro-business loans. </li></br></ul>
<p id="sidehead">

Environment</p><ul class="a"></br><li>
	Banning of deforestation as it often results in wiping out medicinal plants and animal habitats. </li></br><li>
	Adopt an aggressive tree plantation project: More trees trap poisonous carbon compounds, generate oxygen supplies, prevent soil erosion, retain soil moisture, increase water resource, moderate climate, and suppress weeds.  </li></br><li>
	Banning of birds and animal hunting. Instead, repopulate birds and wild animals so as to bring back the natural environment that used to be serene and appealing.  </li></br></ul>
	

<p id="sidehead">Healthcare & Social Welfare</p><ul class="a"></br><li>
	Focus on disease control and preventive healthcare with the goal of decreasing infant mortality (7 deaths per 1,000 births) and increasing life expectancy to 77 years:  </li></br><li>
	All seniors aged 65 and older must be fully cared for by the society: free food stamps, free healthcare, and free transportation (a senior travel pass at government expense). The society must care for its own elderly people who are unable to work and/or without any pension benefits. </li></br><li>
	Free medical services must be provided to all children, low-income families, and the disabled in the villages: annual physical check-up, regular immunizations, first-aids, emergency care, child delivery assistance, referrals, etc. </li></br><li>
	Medical personnel must be accessible by on-call 24-hours services; working hours to be shifted from daytime to evenings; doing house-calls rather than manning office to be the standard rule. </li></br><li>
	Regular training on sanitation and nutrition must be offered. </li></br><li>
	Increase rural access to care by promoting health information technologies like telemedicine.
	Provide emergency airlift services for patients in critical conditions, especially for those in remote part of Nagaland that have no access to vehicular ambulance services. </li></br><li>
	Doctors and nurses who work in villages must be exempt from income taxes. </li></br></ul>

<p id="sidehead">Agriculture</p>

Most of our farmers struggle with just enough to survive because they lack equipment, financial support, and knowledge of biotech that can revolutionize agriculture. So government must adopt a twofold objective: (1) Make the lives of farmers easier—moving them from subsistence agriculture to industrialized standard of living, and (2) produce more crop yields … two times a year.</p><ul class="a"></br><li>
Establish a new program to identify and train the next generation of farmers who can produce crops on commercial scale. </li></br><li>
	Establish Farmers Association; link farmers to each other with real-time information. </li></br><li>
	Build dams to collect the monsoon rains and then spread out the water through irrigation ditches during dry season; employ gravity irrigation—pumping by wind-mills or machines from aquifers, lake, or rivers; adopt watering system by powered machines as done in USA. </li></br><li>
	Encourage the Japanese method of intensive cultivation—growing crops on terraces cut in hillsides and even between buildings and highways. </li></br><li>
	Modernize farming methods through application of latest agricultural science: soil-testing, multiple seeding, crop production enhancements, and post-harvest management. </li></br><li>
	Mechanize farming equipment and tools: power tillers, water pump, paddy harnester, winnowing fan, and other mechanical farm implements. </li></br><li>
	Encourage farmers to also take up horticulture, sericulture and growth of herbal plants. </li></br><li>
	Ensure that production is based on market demands so as to avoid waste. </li></br><li>
	Enact laws to regulate the middle-men who tend to control and influence the market; ensure farmers to get opportunity to bargain with the value chain and get fair returns for their labor. </li></br></ul>
	<p id="sidehead">

Educational Development </p><ul class="a"></br><li>
	Short-Term Goal: 100 percent literacy rate through adult literacy programs and mandatory school education for children. </li></br><li>
	Long-Term Goal: Everyone becomes conversant in the international-trade language, that is, English, starting from phonetics. </li></br><li>
	Increase Pay for Rural Teachers: Provide incentives for talented and qualified teachers, strengthen teacher preparation programs, improve professional development, and better utilize and reward accomplished teachers. </li></br><li>
	Involve Parents: Create Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) for children; empower parents with knowledge. </li></br><li>
	Improve Curriculum: Adopt practical-oriented curriculum; use interactive teaching methods, introduce exposure trips, and grade students based on daily performance.  </li></br><li>
	Modernizing Schools: Educational systems must be supported by high-tech equipment; solar-powered digital library and computers must be made available to students; Internet and phone facility must be provided to teachers. </li></br><li>
	Introduce a Learn-and- Earn Program: This is a drop-out solution for children from low-income families. The requirement for the earning is by taking tutoring and keeping the minimum passing grade. </li></br><li>
	Enforce Mandatory Education:  All children up to class tenth must compulsorily go to school. Without a basic education, young people in the twenty-first century have no good vocational prospect. </li></br><li>
	Reclaim Childhood Program: No individual or business establishment may employ underage children. In addition to going to schools, children must be provided with appropriate facilities for sports, music, and other fun activities. </li></br>
</ul>
<p>
In short, we can, and must, put every village to the top …in our Naga’s way!
