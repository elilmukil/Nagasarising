Mr. Mazie is an ordained minister of the Angami Baptist Church Council, Kohima. He holds several degrees, both secular and theological, including a Ph.D. from Dallas Theological Seminary, Texas.
</p>
<p>
Some of his achievements include starting a few mission organizations and church partnerships that have led to planting over 100 new churches, training hundreds of leaders, and empowering thousands of people both in India and USA. </p>
<p>

As a person with a wide range of interests, Mazie reads widely and enjoys the challenges in various endeavors of life. During the last 35 plus years, he has served in numerous leadership positions and has worn many different “hats.”  To name some: as student union’s president, school principal, college lecturer, research scholar, economic columnist, author, pastor, mission facilitator, building properties manager, real estate investor, project development consultant, international ministry coordinator, and mentor. Also, since July of 2007, he has been calling for a socio-politico-economic transformation in his homeland, Nagaland. </p>
<p>

Although Mazie has recently returned home for good, his wife Rosemary, along with their daughters Abigail and Alerice, have been residents in the USA since 1992. Also, Mazie is a proud grandfather of a 4-year old toddler, Aviu.
