We will Fight for Gender Equality</p>
<p>

Despite major advances in civil and political Rights for women all over the world, our Naga society still has a long way to go in addressing the issue of gender inequality. </p>

The JACWR, in a press release, conveyed deep gratitude to all tribal women’s organizations that successfully organized protest rallies in their respective districts in spite of strong opposition from various quarters to disrupt and prevent women from participating in the rallies on Oct 1, 2012. The JACWR has also thanked Dr. Mazie Nakhro, the lone male in the rally, for his support to women’s rights in Naga society.

When it comes to the Rights of women, we cannot go backwards. We have got to go forward. </p>
<ul class="a"><li>


	We will not go back to the days when survivors of domestic violence had no access to services or recourse against their abusers, because domestic violence was swept under the rug, as a shameful, private issue. We must introduce laws for violence women and provide services to… </li></br><li>
	We are not going back to the days when it was legal for women to be paid less for doing the same work as men. </li></br><li>
	We will work towards encouraging women to serve alongside their male counterparts, both in the Panchayats/Municipalities and at the highest level of our decision-making body, the State Legislative Assembly. </li></br></ul>

We will Fight for Disability Rights</p>
<p>

We should acknowledge that people with disabilities everywhere have played an important role in changing things for the better in their countries. But in Nagaland, too many Nagas with disabilities continue to be left out of the workforce, and space is not provided for them to allow them to use their talents. We must recognize that there is much work to do. </p>
<p id=box>
“There are 29,631 persons with disabilities in Nagaland (2011 Census), many of whom live in abject poverty, lack access to health care, education, suffer physical or sexual violence and remain invisible and neglected. From attaining education to securing a job to being able to just move around and have a regular life, these are all huge challenges for an average person with disability” – Diethono Nakhro

 


 





</p>
<p id="sidehead">

What we will do: </p><ul class="a"><li>

	We must open educational opportunities to all Nagas, expand transportation, make sure everyone can enter public buildings. </li></br><li>

	We will improve access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities. We will ensure that no one would be turned down for a job because of a disability. </li></br></ul>
