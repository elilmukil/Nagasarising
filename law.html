		<p id="heading">Strict Enforcement of Law & Order </p>
<p>
Nagaland’s Police Force has earned the tag of incurring the highest per capita expenditure in the country.  This is because it is over-sized--- the actual strength of total State Police Force (civil & armed) is 24,145, as of 2011, and it eats up a huge chunk of our public funds. But despite all these, it remains as one of the most underutilized police forces in India. Consequently, the level of violence and lawlessness in our State has been only going up, not down. 
</p><p>
Without good police and security forces, our society will slip further into complete anarchy which could eventually result in the loss of our Naga identity and homeland.  We cannot afford to simply stand by and let these things happen. 
</p>
<p id="sidehead">

What We Will Do: 
</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>
	We will bring change to improve the image of our Police and Security personnel.  We will expect all service members to perform their duties professionally at all times and in accordance to the highest standards of conduct. 
</li>
</br>
<li>
We will train our law enforcement forces to be amongst the best in the world. We will provide them with the latest tools and technologies to facilitate cases faster and produce more accurate investigation of crime and detection of criminals … without any political interference. </li>
</br><li>
	Any act of Police brutality and unwarranted harassment of innocent people will be severely dealt with in the form of demotion, employment termination, and/or imprisonment. </li>
	</br><li>
	We will proactively deploy our law enforcement personnel for intelligence gathering, criminal investigation, crime prevention, prosecution cases, and mob control…without fear or favor. </li></br>
	<li>
	We will create a special militarized Police Force equipped with Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) for handling extremely dangerous situations. And we will not hesitate to use this elite Force to engage in combat with any terror group with arms. </li>
	</br><li>
		Anyone committing extortions and/or any criminal act in the name of Naga national movement, or anything else, on our civilian members will be seriously dealt with the full force of the law ... without fear or favor. Security and protection of our public must be our government’s top priority. </li>
		</br><li>
	We will deploy our Police and Security Forces to proactively check the influx of illegal immigrants.
</li></ul>
<p>
We will restore law and order in every nook and corner of our land. We will give security and safety back to our citizens.
