</p>
<p>

Almost all Naga politicians, and our common people alike, seem to believe that we are somehow entitled to live at India’s financial expenses and therefore we don’t have to be serious about generating our own revenues.  Perhaps we also assume that this is how every state government in India, or elsewhere, operates. But the shameful fact---even if we hate to admit it---is this: we are living on the taxes of the Indian people.  When the Indian government imposes taxes in other parts of India, it takes money away from its people who would have otherwise saved and invested, or spent that money. Some twenty years ago, a university professor in Pune asked me why the Nagas had to be supported this way. At that moment, I almost said, “We don’t need your money. We can do just fine on our own.”  But then, we all know too well that we’ve become too dependent on the Indian money supply for our daily survival. </p>
<p>


How does the Central Government of India raise revenue to support itself and the state governments like Nagaland?  The Central Government levies taxes such as Custom Duty (5 – 15%), Central Excise (4 – 30%), Service Tax (12% on general insurance, stock broking, and telephone), Individual Income Tax (0 – 30%), Corporate Tax (30%), Payroll Tax (2 –12.5%, pension contribution), Central Sales Tax (5.5 – 14.5%), Capital Gains Tax, to name just the most common ones. Then, there used to be the Wealth Tax (till end of this March, 2015), which was a tax on property ownership, to be paid annually at its current market value, whether or not such property yields any income.  The Wealth Tax was levied on residential house, guests house, commercial building, motor car, jewelry, gold, silver, yachts, boats, aircrafts, urban land, cash in hand (in excess of Rs.50,000 for individuals), stock in trade, etc.  </p>
<p>

No doubt the Indian tax system is well-structured and comprehensive, but there is a lack of compliance or proper enforcement of the tax laws. As a result, tax evasion is common or sometimes unknown amounts of taxes collected might be disappearing because of administrative loopholes or government corruption. But from whatever is collected, the Central Government must still grant States’ shares from the total revenue raised and make transfer of funds to the various state governments. For example, as per the 14th Finance Commission’s grant to Nagaland, our state was allocated a total of Rs.5838.03 crore for the financial year 2015-16. </p>
<p>

At the local level, the Government of India also allows the various state governments to collect certain taxes. Some of these are in the forms of Value Added Tax (VAT), stamp duty, state excise, land revenue, and profession tax. Furthermore, local bodies are also empowered to levy taxes on properties and on utilities like electricity, water, drainage, etc.  In keeping with these provisions, the Chief Minister of Nagaland, T. R. Zeliang, who holds the Finance Portfolio, appealed to the state legislators in the last budget session to create an all-level awareness among the people of the state to pay taxes and charges due to the government, including electricity and water bills. He also took step to increase floor rates of VAT for basic goods from the existing 4.75% to 5%, for general goods from the existing rate of 13.25% to 14.5%, for tobacco and tobacco products from the existing 18% to 25%, for petroleum products from 4.75% to 5%, and for amusement tax rate on cable and DTH subscribers from the existing Rs.20 to Rs.25 per subscriber per month. To Mr. Zeliang’s credit, these tax increases must be seen as government moves in the right direction, although they may generate only a few crores of Rupees here and there. </p>
<p>

Looking from a political standpoint, India must be blamed for reducing the once-self-sufficient Naga people to a dependent lot. After having initially placed the Nagas under the Ministry of Home Affairs and funded them from the Consolidated Fund of India, it has now left the Nagas politically suppressed and economically helpless to stand on their own feet. These wrongs on the part of India, however, cannot be an excuse for the Nagas to remain forever dependent. Still now, it is up to us to assert our political rights and become economically self-sufficient again. That is, politically we must act like Taiwan in certain areas and come up with our own tax laws to generate our state revenue. </p>
<p>

Rather than just increasing a few percentages on tax rates at the state level, perhaps the Government of Nagaland could dare to follow what other progressive nations do in terms of developing certain tax laws in regard to individual income tax, corporate tax, and property tax in all urban areas. First, let’s look at the example of Singapore. It is able to generate huge revenue from corporate tax (17%), individual income tax (0 – 22%), payroll tax (11.5 – 36%), goods and services/sales tax (7%), and property tax (0 – 15%). 	 Or, in the case of the United States, the tax rates are as follows: corporate tax (0 – 35%), individual income tax (0 – 55.9%), payroll tax (15.9 – 19.1%), sales tax (0 – 11.72%), and property tax, which is the largest source of funds for public schools. In the U.S., most taxes are used to generate revenue, but some taxes, such as those on cigarettes or alcohol, are intended to discourage what society views as undesirable behavior. </p>
<p>

When a government truly exists to serve the people, its citizens are willing to pay their taxes even when the taxes are high because they believe in their government.  For example, my wife and I have faithfully paid our income taxes to the United States of America every year. Perhaps we could cheat on our taxes if we wanted to, but we don’t because we believe that we are better off with paying our taxes because it enables the government to provide excellent education for our children, build world-class roads for our vehicles, enforce the rule of law for our protection, create opportunities for our employment, build many facilities to ensure a comfortable living standard, invest portions of our taxes for our future needs, plus much more.      </p>
<p>
         

Unfortunately, most Nagas seem to hate even the idea of paying taxes to their government. Perhaps this reluctance is because they don’t trust their government or believe that their politicians will do what they are supposed to do for the common people. But this attitude must be changed, and it will possibly happen the day when we have selfless public servants who will truly put the interest of others above their own. In other words, a good government can raise revenue relatively easy because it can attract willing taxpayers to support its services.
