</p>
<p>
The rule of law refers to the ability of a government to enforce the laws of the country, particularly with respect to protecting private property and enforcing contracts. Economists at the World Bank have ranked 118 developing countries on the basis of how well their governments enforce the rule of law in 2000. The 20 developing countries that have the strongest rule of law, such as Czech Republic and Israel, grew more than six times faster during the 1990s than the 20 developing countries that have the weakest rule of law, such as the Congo and Albania. </p>
<p>

Where there is political instability or a corrupt government, the economy cannot grow. Contracts are hard to enforce, and frauds often go unpunished. In some cases, the government not only fails to enforce property rights but actually infringes upon them. To do business in such environments, people are expected to bribe powerful government officials. Therefore, domestic residents have less incentive to invest or start new businesses. At the same time, foreign investors stay away from investing in such politically unstable places. </p>
<p>

Of course, the market system left to its own devices can also create a lot of social inequalities, economic disparities, and environmental problems. When lawlessness exists, the rich and the powerful often form nexus to promote their own self-interests and accumulate wealth at the expense of the poor. Or, firms may cut corners in pursuit of profit in ways that make the society worse off. For example, a manufacturing firm has the incentive to reduce production costs by dumping its by-product wastes on nearly vacant land than by paying to get rid of them properly.  Still many people, who are unaware of these hazardous problems, will actually reward the firm by buying more of its products, which will be cheaper than what can be produced by competitors that pay to dispose of their wastes in a more responsible way. The best way to correct problems like this is through a nonmarket mechanism. This is where the government steps in and plays a very crucial role in the market economy because the government is not another profit-making business per se but a socio-political institution that can use the law to serve the interests of all who live within its geo-political jurisdiction. </p>
<p>

On the other hand, the poor are also not without self-interests either. In fact, some of the poor can be more selfish and greedy than the rich, except that they express these vices in a different way. For instance, they may choose to be free riders of the system instead of taking responsibility to contribute their part to grow the common wealth. Let me use an imaginary situation to illustrate my point:  Let us assume that I was able to put a satellite into orbit so that it could send television signals directly to where I am staying in Kohima. Let’s also say that it could provide me with many modern conveniences such as direct phone communication, GPS-based navigation for directions, information about wind currents, or ability to forecast rainfall, to name a few. Since my cost would be astronomical to install this system, I ask all the residents of Kohima to share my cost because I knew that they too can easily receive all these benefits for their private use.  In the real world, most people might choose not to pay me any fee because they have an opportunity to be free riders of my system without my knowledge.  On my part, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to exclude people who might not pay for the services they would use. Knowing this full well, I wouldn’t want to pay the full cost of the system myself. In the end, we get no satellite system even though it might have made all of us better off. </p>
<p>

Free riders can cripple enterprises. In the absence of good government or the courts, firms cannot force consumers to pay for the goods and services the latter get, no matter how much utility they may receive or how often they may use them. For that matter, any system of voluntary payment falls prey to the free riders. Due to these reasons, every society needs to have a good government that can enforce laws and regulations to hold everyone accountable.  </p>
<p>

Without a good government, society becomes a “dogs eat dogs” situation---that is, everyone tries to live off other people. Failure of the rule of law is one reason why nepotism, clans, and other family-centered behaviors are so common in developing countries, including India. In such situations, even reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work. </p>
<p>

A good government, like an umpire in a World Series game, sets rules and enforces them for a functional market economy. It defines and protects property rights. In fact, a market system cannot work well unless property rights are enforced. Entrepreneurs are unlikely to start anything big because investors are unlikely to lend them funds unless there are courts or the rule of law to protect their investments from being arbitrarily seized. But when there is the rule of law, or the access to an independent judicial system, even complex contractual agreements between total strangers can occur. For instance, we can take substantial amounts of money to our bank and hand it over to people we have never met before. We do so because we trust that the system is in place and credible enough so that we would not need to worry that the person at the bank who takes our money won’t just pocket it. Or that when we use credit cards to buy some goods over the Internet, from a business that is located in some other state or country, we are confident that we will get our merchandise, and they are confident that they will get paid. </p>
<p>

For a market system to work, businesses and individuals rely on the courts to enforce contracts and protect property rights. But if these are missing, the production of goods and services will be reduced, leaving the economy stagnant. </p>
<p>

Thus, good government (or more specifically, the rule of law) matters. The more sophisticated our economy becomes, the more sophisticated our government institutions need to be. The role of government in e-commerce is a good example. Although the private sector is usually the engine of growth for e-commerce, it is the government that makes online transactions legally binding through the legal system---that is, the courts enforce contracts, protect property rights, settle disputes, discourage thefts, and root out frauds. This way, the rule of law does not just fix the rough edges of the market system, but it makes a market economy possible to function and thrive for the benefit of all. </p>
