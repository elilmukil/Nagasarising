If completing the required readings of certain textbooks, attending class lectures, and producing correct answers to questions in exams were enough to earn an MBA degree, then I would say that I had fulfilled those few requirements many years ago, because I was after the degree and there was a university offering it through an extension program.  Now looking back, would I still recommend such a system of education with no extra-curricular requirements?  Perhaps not! 
</p>
<p>

In most universities in India, education is still largely about absorbing content and being able to recall it on exams. The teacher is essentially someone passing information to an inert audience in a one-way, linear fashion.  In today’s world, and for today’s students, this model of education is not considered suitable or sufficient.  If you, for instance, took a technical course in the first year of your college, half of what you learned may be obsolete by the fourth year. </p>
<p>

So, how can educationists introduce system-wide changes to reorient student toward educating tech-savvy learners or would-be entrepreneurs? </p>
<p>

Today’s colleges and universities need an entirely new modus operandi for how the content of higher education is created. To do this, they need to, first of all, toss out the traditional model of pedagogy (the lecture-driven teaching method) and replace it with a new model called collaborative learning. A research conducted in 2000 by Harvard Graduate School of Education shows that students who studied in groups were more engaged in their studies, were better prepared for class, and learned significantly more than students who worked on their own.  It appears that when students get engaged in mutual exploration and group problem solving, they take more interests in studies and assume a greater responsibility for their own learning.  Perhaps that’s why a scandal of education is that every time a teacher simply offers a spoon-fed teaching to a student, he deprives the latter of the pleasure and benefit of discovery. </p>
<p>

Since effective learning occurs when students want to learn and in a delivery style that is best for them, our education system has to change to suit our students of the 21st century.  In advanced countries, and in most developing countries, young people are having access to computers connected to high-speed Internet. Therefore, instead of fidgeting in their chairs while the teachers lecture and scribble some notes on the whiteboard, today’s tech-savvy learners are exploring and discovering many things with the help of their computers. As such, the role of teachers must change with the time. In other words, teachers will be more effective if they serve as knowledge facilitators and guide students in their learning process. When this change occurs, students’ learning is more likely to improve. </p>
<p>

Indeed, today’s students can no longer depend only on their textbooks and course materials for learning.  To keep up with the fast-paced world, they must use a variety of educational resources and learning methods, such as online discussions, social media, and other tools to study any subject. This is called Global Network for Higher Learning.  For example, imagine that you, as a student, could not only read books or listen to lectures but also virtually collaborate with other students anywhere through the Internet to learn about what it is like to be an architect, an innovator, or an entrepreneur. The immersive nature of such an experience can certainly broaden your knowledge and prepare you well for the job market of the future. </p>
<p>

If we are to reorient our entire curriculum for training entrepreneurial leaders, educators from various disciplines must collaborate so that their students can gain the “big ideas” from their disciplinary perspectives and develop a more holistic understanding of any subject or issue. In fact, an entire curriculum could be designed toward developing entrepreneurs. For example, a technology teacher who teaches an IT course could highlight the importance of networks and show how students can leverage their entrepreneurial career through the use of social media. Likewise, someone who teaches an operations management course could include a module on sustainable operations; another who teaches a marketing course might consider “green” products so as to develop entrepreneurs who will be socially and environmentally responsible. In other courses that consider global issues, such as economics and strategy, the concerned teachers could help students to develop their contextual awareness so that they can someday successfully navigate changes in industries and governments. Simply put, management teachers by working together could develop the next generation of entrepreneurial leaders who will shape social and economic opportunity across diverse contexts. </p>
<p>

Higher education should place more emphasis on providing students with extra-curricular experiences (or better put, co-curricular requirements), which are activities outside of the classroom that complement the general curriculum.  For example, college students taking business courses could practice to be entrepreneurs. To make things more systematic, such co-curricular learning opportunities can be divided into three phases: explore, pursue, and launch.  In the first phase, a student, under the guidance of a faculty advisor, can “explore” what he or she might like to do, what the opportunities are, and what the appropriate mode of action might be. In the “pursue” phase, the student can still use the same advisor and begin testing the market.  If the test result is positive, then he or she can proceed to write a business plan, develop prototypes, and build a team. Finally, in the “launch” phase, the assembled leadership team can not only seek advice from external business leaders but also find people who will invest in their new business venture. As they progress through these three phases, they can market their products and services and create a revenue stream. </p>
<p>

Since I really believe that these above-mentioned concepts have the potential to improve learning in a big way, I am excited that the upcoming North East Christian University in Nagaland is considering to adopt an innovative pedagogy to prepare their students who will meet the challenges of the 21st century (in a way this article is a response to a request from the NECU’s Pro Chancellor, Huzo Meru). Similarly, my hope is that other educators and policymakers in Nagaland will reorient our current education model so that it will appropriately and adequately meet the needs of educating our next generation of entrepreneurial leaders who will be capable of creating many new social and economic opportunities for our people. </p>
