<p>
</p>

The importance of education for economic growth is very much recognized and well-accepted in all developed countries. Even multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF have all acknowledged that education plays a very important role in not only reducing poverty but also in creating more stable governments and more tolerant societies. As early as 1990, the World Conference on Education, convened by most of these bodies, set universal primary education as a goal for every country by the year 2000 (a goal that  has been missed by many  countries). <p>
</p>

At the same time, there are also many examples of highly educated countries where economic performance has been miserable. For example, Russia and most Eastern European countries could boast about excellent performance at their primary and secondary levels for most of their populations, but those economies have been in much poorer conditions than other developed countries and, in some instances, even worse off than some developing countries where education may still be lagging far behind. But the reason for their poor economic conditions may have more to do with flawed political system, where entrepreneurs cannot really thrive in the absence of private property rights. <p>
</p>

But assuming that, under the right institutional conditions, education is an important factor for a growing economy, the question is whether economies can earn a greater return overall from concentrating their educational investments among a particular section of people, or whether a more universal approach is better.  For example, India is focusing more on the former model (a targeted approach) as her financial investment on higher education and skill development is increasing, while funds for school education and literacy have been reduced by 2 percent in the 2015 Union Budget, leaving hundreds of millions still unable to read or write. In contrast, Southeast Asian countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan put greater emphasis on providing universal primary education when they were at similar stages of economic development. According to the economist and Nobel laureate Gary Becker, “these so-called Asian tigers grew rapidly by relying on a well-trained, educated, hard-working, and conscientious labor force.” <p>
</p>

Education is what makes individuals productive, and productivity is what determines our standard of living. But many low-income countries have weak public educational systems, so workers are unable to follow the “how-to-do” instructions. Few workers acquire the skills necessary to use the latest technology.  Or, sometimes children may drop out of school at an early age, even though the benefit of additional schooling is very high, simply because their labor is needed to help support the family. For reasons such as these, many low-income countries remain poor. In the United States, each year of schooling has historically raised a person’s wage on average by 10 percent. Thus, one way government policy can enhance the standard of living is to provide good schools and to encourage the populations to take advantage of them. <p>
</p>

Some economists would argue that education is particularly important for economic growth because it provides some positive externalities, which are effects, say, of one person’s actions for the benefits of others.  An educated person, for instance, might generate new ideas about how best to produce goods and services. If these ideas enter society’s pool of knowledge so everyone can use them, then the ideas are an external benefit of education. In this case, the returns of schooling for society are even greater than the returns for the individual. This argument would justify the large government subsidies or investments to public education. <p>
</p>

To be sure, education alone is not a sufficient condition for the growth of an economy. Sometimes government corruption and unstable political situation, among other factors, can offset any growth-enhancing impact of education.  Or, sometimes corruption can result in driving away the highly educated and successful individuals for higher-income countries, where they can enjoy a higher standard of living, thereby leaving their home countries in a situation of brain drain. This happened to India because of government corruption and excessive bureaucratic interferences until recently. But now as corruption is being checked more vigorously and the Indian economy is growing, many NRIs are returning home. In addition, today’s India is having more entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists deciding to remain in India rather than leave for the U.S. or other high-income countries. <p>
</p>

Education is likely to be more critical for economic success in the future than ever before. The founders of some of the leading Internet-based companies---Amazon, eBay, Google, and Yahoo---were all college graduates. Looking ahead, it seems quite unlikely that the future commercially applicable advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology, neurotechnology, and information technology will be made by high school graduates. On the contrary, innovations in these sectors, along with others, are likely to be developed either in some university settings or by individuals with advanced university education, especially in math and science. <p>
</p>

Indeed, we are living in a time of great opportunity.  There are already numerous proposals for change coming from within academia itself. Some advocate Web-based distance learning and the elimination of campuses. Others argue that we need more technology in higher education, or colleges should be opened up and made free to all. There are also renewed calls to abolish teaching tenure, and even to replace traditional departments with a few sets of problem-focused disciplines. But whatever structures or systems of education may emerge in the future, they will radically affect businesses, governments, and people everywhere. <p>
</p>

A nation’s economic growth is determined not only by its level of educational attainments but also by the quality of its on-the-job training programs (skill-development & apprenticeship). Skilled workers generate economic growth by creating new jobs or doing old jobs better. However, skilled workers usually need other skilled workers to succeed. For example, someone who is trained as a heart surgeon can succeed only if there are well-equipped hospitals, trained nurses, firms that sell drugs and medical supplies, and a large enough population with sufficient funds to spend for medical treatment. In other words, those who become skilled find that they can make more money or be more successful in a region or country with a higher proportion of skilled workers. That’s why skilled workers tend to stay away from poor countries where they are only few skilled workers. As World Bank economist William Easterly has written, the result can be a vicious cycle: “If a nation starts out skilled, it gets more skilled. If it starts out unskilled, it stays unskilled.”  <p>
</p>

To sum up, education yields benefits to society beyond those who have attained it themselves. More educated people are not only more informed citizens, thus improving the working of democracy, but a more educated society produces more innovation, thereby enhancing economic growth. That is, as societies become more educated, or more accurately, as their labor forces become more skilled, their economy can grow faster.</p>
