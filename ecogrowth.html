All our politicians seem to believe that growing our economy is all about rushing off to meet their “Sahibs” in Delhi with their begging bowls on one hand and our Naga traditional jackets on the other hand. Their incompetence and ignorance about creating productivity and economic growth are clearly evident in three areas: </p>


<ol class="c"><li>
<span id="sidehead">Inability to Create Productive Business Enterprises:</span>  According to a 2015 Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the State’s returns from investment of Rs. 278.44 crore in 2014-15 in various financial instruments and companies stood at zero yearning.  Nagaland has five government companies—four working and one not working. Even the four working companies—Nagaland Industrial Development Board, Nagaland Industrial Raw Material & Supply Corporation Ltd, State Mineral Development Corporation, and Nagaland Handloom & Handicraft Development Corporation—are only incurring losses. 

</li></br><li>
<span id="sidehead">Inability to Reduce Accruing Interest Rates on Loans:</span>  On borrowing loans during 2014-15, our government is paying an average rate of 6.81%.  For example, taking loan to buy a Rs.15-lakh luxury car at 10.40% for a 5-year term for each Minister would cost a total of Rs. 19,29,995.61. This means paying for 60 new cars for 60 ministers every 5 year would cost the public an extra amount of Rs.11,57,99,736.60 (that is, over Rs.11.5 crore for 60 new luxury cars).  But as relief to affected families during the cyclonic storms that damaged a total of 3759 houses in April of 2016, the government gave only Rs.2.5 crore. 
</li></br><li>

<span id="sidehead">Inability to Check Financial Misappropriation and Losses:</span> According to CAG Report as of 2015, there were 34 cases of misappropriations and losses amounting to Rs. 616 crores in 15 departments.
</li></ol>
<p>
Because of the incompetence of our leaders, coupled with their corrupt governance, Nagaland has earned a tagged as one of the worst places to do businesses in India (World Bank).

Political instability could throw the economic locomotive off course. On the other hand, political stability can fuel the same locomotive engine to move forward. As such, our government must provide a political structure that ensures market stability and encourages economic growth.

We must go the route of having less government in business and more business in government. In other words, most present government undertakings must be turned over to the private sectors to manage. Privatization will create competition, innovation, efficiency, and better quality of services. This will result in having its citizens to be less concerned about what the government can do for them and more anxious about what they can do for the nation. 		</p>

We Must Turn Every Job into a Valued Profession
</p></center>
<p>

The Nagas must avoid reliance on a single product or career. We must unashamedly claim any income-earning job. Unemployment does not have to be a problem as long as we are physically able and mentally fit. We must take up all kinds of jobs. We can work as manufacturers, traders, brokers, suppliers, retailers, craftsmen, carpenters, house builders, road construction workers, mechanics, electricians, plumbers, cobblers, porters, barbers, animal breeders, sculptors, masons, designers, weavers, carpenters, cosmetologists, taxi drivers, tourist guides, waitress, cooks, etc. For the creative, there is no limit to job opportunities. </p>
<p>

In order to reclaim lost jobs to illegal migrants and non-locals, the government must use a work permit system; that is, everyone running a business, big or small, must obtain a work permit. This business ordinance must apply to all local and non-local people alike. Selling things on the roadside, setting up stores under temporary structure, and running a business in a substandard manner must be banned.   </p>
<p>

Labor disgraces no man, but occasionally men disgrace labor. Therefore, dignity of labor must be restored—the belief that work is a blessing and one must take pride in providing for his family. To get rid of the negative stigma often associated with menial jobs, we must professionalize and standardize every conceivable job, including menial works like coolie labor. For instance, a Coolie Labor Association could be formed and professionalize itself in the following ways: conduct training for its members, assist its members to obtain government licenses (work permits), apply for government loans, acquire mechanical equipment and rent them to its members at a discount, set standards/policies of work and wages, and adopt group health insurance plans. </p>

The Government Must Provide Appropriate Incentives</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>

	Create a legal system that protects private property rights to encourage free enterprises.</li></br><li>
	Everything must be done to support small businesses. To produce more, businesses need to hire more workers; in turn, this reduces the unemployment problem. </li></br><li>
	Conduct soft-skill trainings and position young people to be industry ready. </li></br><li>
	Provide self-employment training and business development programs in micro-businesses. </li></br><li>
	Offer credit loans to qualified candidates who will start small businesses; provide subsidies to first-time entrepreneurs who launch new businesses. </li></br><li>
	Give tax credit (exemption from corporate income tax) to new businesses for the first 5 years so it can succeed, expand, and hire new workers. </li></br><li>
	Encourage various types of business organizations which will provide diversities in investments and more options for business ownership: sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations. </li></br><li>
	To produce skilled workforce and bring modern know-how to jobs, the government must let young people hook up to cable TV, surf the Internet, and study abroad. </li></br><li>
	Attract non-Nagas from anywhere in the world to come to Nagaland and work in Nagaland provided they will create jobs for the Nagas and pay taxes to our government. </li></br><li>
	Attract the expertise of outsiders, especially Indians, to help build a progressive and prosperous Nagaland. These people could be educationists, scientists, engineers, architects, urban developers, industry experts, mechanists, technologists, innovators, herbal researchers, businesspersons, social workers, journalists, etc.

                   The Government Must Develop Trade with the Outside World
</p></center>
<p>
<span id="sidehead">Work with India as an Ally:</span> With a 1.1 billion population, Indian represents a huge market for businesses. In fact, it is emerging as the second largest consumer market in the world, with a buying middle class numbering over half a billion. Thus, the Nagas must see India as a consumer market, a supplier, a competitor, and an investment destination. </p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Establish Free Trade with the Outside World: </span>Nagaland must develop linkages with the outside world by building an international-level trade-hub between India and the Southeast Asian countries. For this to take place, we must invest in building cross-border infrastructure and also ease trade restrictions such as quotas and tariffs which prevent consumers from buying cheaper foreign substitutes. For instance, steel mills in India produce steel 2-3 times more expensively than what it will cost if it is imported from Thailand. In other words, free trade benefits consumers as more competitions will result in better products at lower prices.   </p>

             <div class="otherecoparatext2"> 
<span id="sidehead">Attract Multinational Companies to Invest:</span> Outside investors must be attracted for all-round development in the State which can lead to job creations, faster economic growth, and higher standard of living. For this to take place, the people must ensure political stability, that is, the government must not change often, or terrorist groups must not threaten their business investments.  </p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Invest in Building a Skilled Workforce:</span> Unskilled workers often produce less but take away a huge chunk of funds in the forms of salaries. In contrast, skilled workers can produce more and generate more revenue. Therefore, one of government’s top priorities should be to produce a skilled workforce.  </p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Seek Outside Assistance:</span> Experts from developed countries must assist in training the Naga workforce and in developing our nation’s infrastructure. Trained workforce will ensure proper utilization of natural resources necessary for an industrial economy. </p>
<p>

<span id="sidehead">Invest in Machinery: </span>The government must heavily invest in machinery that can increase the speed of development and productivity, thus ushering in industrial economy at a faster rate. </p>
