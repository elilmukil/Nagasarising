<p>

Mazie’s mother, Deno, came from a very patriotic Naga family from Khonoma, 20 kilometers west of Kohima, Nagaland. Her family was rather well-known because of her grandfather, Pelhu Dolie, who helped bring an end to the 48-year long intermittent “war” with the British in 1880. Even A.Z. Phizo, the architect of the Naga Freedom Movement, is believed to have been ideologically inspired by his grandfather, Pelhu. So, their sense of Naga identity and patriotism has run very deep in their family for several generations.  </p><p>

While still a young girl, Deno’s life was turned upside down when her father Goyie Dolie accidentally shot and killed his friend while on a hunting trip. Following a Naga customary law, they had to flee to another Naga village for a period of seven years. As a “refugee child” in another village, she grew up experiencing discrimination from her peers. Her situation worsen when she fell in love with a handsome, easy-going, fun-loving man (Mazie’s father) from her host community.
</p><p>
In the 50s and 60s, Deno opened her house in Jotsoma as a home for many Naga national workers. It also became a meeting place where any topic about the Naga freedom movement was freely shared and discussed. The national spirit of the people at that time was very high, to say the least. 
</p><p>
But in 1958 the Indian Parliament passed the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) that allowed the Indian Army legal immunity to arrest, shoot, or kill anyone in Nagaland even based on mere suspicion. This resulted in thousands of people dead, hundreds of villages burnt, and countless number of women raped. For the Nagas who lived at that time, their desperate longing was freedom from their aggressors. It was during such a period of oppression that Deno gave birth to her youngest son on November 15, 1958.  Thus she named him “Mazie,” meaning “Victor.”  
</p><p>
Sadly, her son was born with a life-threatening heart condition and was not expected to survive very long. It was only because of some Naga national workers bringing her two Mizo doctors that saved his life. 
</p><p>
As a child, Mazie grew up surrounded by Naga national workers. Once he saw the face of fear in the eyes of a Naga soldier who barely made an escape from an almost wiped-out ambush. Among others, this little boy became very attached to two uncles. His favorite uncle was Dobou Chase, the first Speaker of the NNC Assembly, who would often put him on his lap and narrate story after story of Naga heroism. While sitting on his uncle’s lap, the inquisitive lad once asked, “Uncle, why is it that your hair grows in your nose but not on your forehead?” Unfortunately, his uncle was shot and killed. The name of the other uncle was Balhou, an Army Brigadier, whose unloaded handgun Mazie would sometimes played with. But he too was killed in a battle. Having faced these losses, Mazie began nursing intense hate against the Indians even as a young boy and was totally determined to kill the Indian people someday.   
</p><p>
At age 16, Mazie decided to go to China for training so that he might someday be part of liberating the Naga people from India. He began recruiting some of his friends to join him, talked with some Naga national workers, made all the necessary travel arrangements, and even fixed their date for departure. 
</p><p>
But just two weeks before these new recruits were to leave Nagaland, Mazie’s mother became extremely disturbed in her spirit. Perhaps it had something to do with a mother’s intuition. She felt that something awful was going to happen to her son. Heated verbal exchanges went on in their family for days. Nevertheless realizing that her son was stubbornly determined, she broke out in tears, saying her last words, as it were: “You’ve been the apple of my eye. Now how can I bear the thought of losing you? How can I even have a peaceful meal when I’d be worrying that you may be starving somewhere? And how can I go on living when I’d be always be wondering if you’re dead somewhere or being caught and tortured by someone? Please allow me to die first, even if you must leave!” Thus, the pressure became almost unbearable!  So, Mazie resorted to escaping from this situation to get some breathing space for himself. While many miles away from home and asleep in a quiet jungle, something strange happened to him again. He distinctively heard his mother’s voice calling for him. So, he immediately returned home only to discover that his mother had gone into a coma as a result of heartbreak. 
</p><p>
There was mourning, crying, and praying going on at their home in the village. Realizing that it was all because of him, Mazie cried out to God he had always doubted. He simply prayed, “God, if you are truly there, please bring my Mom back to life. If you’ll do that, I’d drop my plan about going to China!”  Amazingly, she came out of her coma! 
</p><p>
As for the rest of his friends, they proceeded with their trip as scheduled. Their journey was undoubtedly perilous because one of them fell critically sick and later died on the way, while the others were attacked and captured at some international border.   
</p><p>
Having given up all hope of going to China, Mazie now turned into a rebel at home. As a sign of that, he started growing very long hair and once even shaved his head and eyebrows to look weird. Also, he would often dress himself in a cowboy-styled outfit. On a few occasions, he even went to church carrying weapons, causing distraction to the young people during prayers. Just for the fun of it, he tried stealing, gambling, drinking, and smoking heavily. As a protest, he dropped out of school too. But all these rebellious acts became somewhat boring to him after some time, so he returned to school after having lost a year. Back at school, he was still a troublemaker. He fought with teachers and even instigated the entire student high school student body to boycott the Indian Independence Day. His arrogance got the best of him at times as it did land him into fistfights with bigger guys who just became fed up with him.
</p><p>
Once again, Mazie’s mother started worrying very much about her son. Although he had never really bothered much about what anyone would say or think about him, he always had a soft corner for her in his heart. It was as if she only she knew how to get through his hard head and stubborn will. No wonder she was able to talk him into attending a Christian Gospel Camp in Kohima in April 1976. It was at this camp that Mazie became fascinated by the story of Jesus, a radical and revolutionary sort of a person himself. Then, being confronted by Jesus’ claims, Mazie eventually surrendered his life to Him as his Lord.  And soon after, he felt strangely relieved and different.
</p><p>
His belief and way of thinking had now taken a very different turn. He started to reject anything that showed any resemblance of his old way of life. This time he wanted to be very godly and spiritual. He began with visiting all those he needed to ask for forgiveness. On one occasion, he volunteered to clean up the vomit of a drunken man on a public bus he was traveling. 
</p><p>
In addition to all his spiritual activities, Mazie became all the more serious in his academic pursuit. He would study extra hard to thoroughly master the content of his required courses, and would even prepare himself ahead for next-level courses. At times he would jokingly boast before the younger ones in his family circle, saying, “Even if I want to fail, I can’t! Those who set exam questions just make them too easy!” 
</p><p> 
On the other hand, Mazie became very proud and also grew more and more dogmatic about his beliefs. He saw everything as either good or evil. He was also extremely intolerant, especially with people whom he thought were religious hypocrites. Soon he found himself in religious controversies and became quite unpopular among certain theologians and Christian leaders. His religious zeal led him to an attempt of reforming his hometown church in Jotsoma. But failing to convince everyone to come on board with him, he split the 2,000+  member church. 
</p><p>
Another hang-up which lingered on with Mazie was hate. As far as the Indian people were concerned, he still saw them as his enemies. The thought of it, however, became increasingly disturbing to him as a professing disciple of Jesus. It was as if Jesus was saying, “Choose love or hate.” Finally, Mazie chose love! And indeed, that decision was an experience of freedom and relief from the heavy burden of hate!
</p><p>
To turn this newly made decision into a real experience, Mazie sought to love the Indian people and serve them. This led him to leave home so as to serve the Indian people in other parts of India. Soon he discovered that they were very loveable and loving. In turn, he fell in love with them. In fact, he even ended up marrying a woman from Maharashtra, although it was against the wish of his own people. As expected, Mazie brought his new bride home to Nagaland in 1990. Of course, she had no clue about how to do anything the Naga way. On one occasion, this resulted in a big fight between the newly married couple. This time Mazie’s mother stood by her daughter-in-law and scolded her own son, saying, “You must show her more understanding as she’s far away from her loved-ones and her familiar surroundings. Don’t make her feel bad or sad. She doesn’t have to do everything like we do. We should let her feel that she can always be her own self with us.”    
 </p><p>
Some years later, Deno sent her son off to America with this blessing: “Now, Son, you’ll be going far away from home, but go wherever the Lord leads you. Someday you’ll hear that I may not make it any longer but don’t worry about coming home just to see me. I want you to keep on doing whatever God has called you to do, rather than thinking about me.” 
</p><p>
In short, Mazie is who he is today because of his mother’s love, sacrifice, wisdom, and prayers.  </p>
