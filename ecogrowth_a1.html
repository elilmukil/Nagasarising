<p>
Some Naga politicians try to make government run businesses rather than empower the private sector to do it. If this were the right way to grow economy, then the most government-intensive countries in the world---like North Korea, Cuba, and Myanmar---would be economic powerhouses. If the USSR taught us anything, it is that monopoly stifles any need to be innovative or responsive to customers. Historically, government-controlled economies are known to have killed market competition and slowed down economic growth. 
</p>
<p>

Crony capitalism usually creeps in when government undertakes businesses. For example, projects that are lavished with government funds are often diverted to dubious characters who are connected to powerful politicians. Or, sometimes some political leaders may confer market monopoly privileges on relatives and friends. In other cases, they may “invent” projects just to please their voting members who can keep them in power, although they make no economic sense. Such vote-seeking politicians will not weigh objectively all the benefits and costs of various programs as economic rationality demands, but will often favor spending on programs that have immediate benefits or deferred costs. And what of the tendency of some political leaders to favor spectacular “showpiece” projects at the expense of less showy but more productive programs?  As a result of these inclinations, resources are squandered and the economy may not perform anywhere near its potential. </p>
<p>

Private sector companies allocate resources where they will earn the highest return, whereas government allocates resources wherever the political process sends them. In other words, government and private sector operate in very different ways. To illustrate this point, let’s say that an entrepreneur crosses the road to earn higher points, but government officials will be standing by the road demanding a toll fee from him, if not blocking the road entirely. Indeed, it would be understandable to have government officials blocking the road if the entrepreneur is carrying a bag of cocaine drugs. But if that’s not the case, it makes more sense that the government helps the entrepreneur to succeed rather than creates hurdles for him. </p>
<p>

Government operations are often inefficient as we would expect given the lack of incentives or external pressures. Think of government employees in the Department of State Transport, Indian Airlines, Indian Postal Service, State Banks of India, government-managed hotels, or utility bills collection offices. What is the point of being friendly to clients, making customers comfortable, adding clerks to shorten lines, interrupting a personal call when a customer comes to the window, saying “how may I help you?” or “thank you” to customers, staying open longer, or keeping the office clean?  None of these good customer services or kind acts will make any difference in the employees’ salary nor will any slackness at work jeopardize their jobs. Compare that to a private sector service: if workers are found underperforming, they will be fired from work and shown the door. As such, workers in the private sector have to be willing to go the extra mile to serve their clients. This goes to show that economy can be better managed when it is run by the private sector. </p>
<p>

Usually, governments are poor at managing resources. For example, when a property is owned by the government, the incentive to take good care of it is weakened. That’s why government-owned buildings, compared to privately-owned buildings, are generally run down and poorly maintained. Private ownership, on the other hand, encourages wise stewardship. For if private owners fail to maintain their properties, they bear the consequences in the form of a decline in the properties’ value. Or let’s use another example: if you own an automobile, you have a strong incentive to have the car serviced regularly and see that it is well maintained. Why is this so?  Because, if the car is kept in good running condition, it will be of greater value to you and to others who might want to buy it from you. </p>
<p>

An important duty of government is to be good steward of public funds---that no public money is wasted or lost. But from the investment point of view, many governments perform very poorly when they get into loan business. Of course, a common argument for its entering into lending business is that it will make loans to people who could not afford to get from private lenders. This is only another way of saying that the government lenders will take risk with the public money. And when it does, it almost invariably ends up with a huge percentage of losses. In contrast, private lenders operate by very different standards. Since private lenders risk their own funds, or funds of others that have been entrusted to them, they are usually very careful in their investigations to determine the adequacy of the assets pledged and the business acumen and honesty of the borrowers. </p>
<p>

As Jerry Jordan, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, U.S.A., has noted, “What separates the economic ‘haves’ from the ‘have-nots’ is whether the role of the economy’s institutions---particularly its public institutions---is to facilitate production or to confiscate it.” Unfortunately, most governments in the developing countries do the latter. </p>
<p>

The role of government is to facilitate economic growth. To do so, government must play a supporting role for the private sector to thrive and succeed.  First, government can lower the cost of doing businesses in the private sector in the following ways: providing uniform rules and regulations, protecting private property rights, enforcing contract agreements, and rooting out fraud.  Rule of law makes markets more credible. Otherwise, business deals are guaranteed only by some kind of personal relationship, which is one reason why nepotism, clans, and family-centered behaviors are so common in developing countries. Second, government must build and maintain infrastructure---roads and bridges, water reservoirs and pipelines, power supply and communication networks---that makes private commerce less costly. Third, government must enhance the productive capacity of the economy by correcting externalities, particularly in the environmental realm---that is, government must try to limit the use of common resources, such as community forests, clean air, and congested roads, because when people are not charged for the use of public goods, they tend to be exploited or used excessively. But when government policies are well planned and well run, the allocation of resources can be more efficient and thus raise economic well-being. </p>
<p>

So, what does all this mean?  Simply put, government plays some very crucial roles in the economy, especially in dealing with externalities; but it should not be the sole provider of a good or service unless there is a compelling reason that the private sector will fail in that role. Or, as the heading of this article says, the less the economy is left to politics, the better. </p>
