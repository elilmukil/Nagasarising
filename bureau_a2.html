		<p id="heading">      Fixing our broken welfare system to help the under-privileged
</p>
<p>
Is the welfare system necessary? The answer is unquestionably yes. However, the purpose for any welfare system should be to help the “under-privileged” who struggle for reasons beyond their control---that is, those individuals who are temporarily facing problems caused by unexpected crisis, social injustices, or certain anomalies in the government system. This implies that welfare programs are not even for those who remain poor because they are lazy or haven’t tried to find productive jobs. We must separate the hard-working from the lazy, the disabled from the abled bodied, and the needy from the greedy. Making this distinction is crucial to serving the under-privileged well. 
</p>
<p>

For example, when welfare programs in the United States were introduced in the 1960s, they were focused on education and training as a means of developing "human capital"--- skills and knowledge that increase the value of labor. The goal was to help those on public assistance become self-sufficient, aiding them in the ascent out of poverty. In those early days, according to Marvin Olasky, welfare recipients “themselves viewed welfare as a necessary wrong, but not a right. The Protestant work ethic lived on. Dependency was thought so dishonorable that, as late as the mid-1960s, only about half of those eligible for welfare payments were receiving them, and many of the enrolled were taking only part of the maximum allowance.” 
</p>
<p>

In the case of India, the welfare schemes or programs are too many and still growing.  Although the original intentions behind these schemes may be noble, most of them are not narrowed enough to serve only the intended target group.  Another problem is this: many of the welfare programs have become an end in themselves.  This has led even beneficiaries to take counterproductive actions that cause poverty in the first place--- not working. Thus, our welfare system ends up causing poverty rather than solving it. 
</p>
<p>

Coming to Nagaland, we have uncritically adopted a flawed welfare system from India. Instead of using the centrally sponsored welfare schemes to serve us well, we have only perpetuated all the wrong things. Here are some examples: 
</p>
<p>

<i>The powerful amongst us have led in the abuse of our welfare system.</i> In the absence of proper accountability, our leaders are unafraid to take a large cut from the public welfare funds for themselves or redirect them to benefit their own family members and political supporters. Thus, our welfare system is often not helping the people it is supposed to. </p>
<p>

<i>The “deserving poor” amongst us are still staying dependent.</i> When the government provides handouts, subsidized goods, and free public services with no strings attached, it indirectly takes away people’s incentives to work hard. Individuals who are poor often come to expect that the government should take care of them and meet their needs, no matter what the cause of their economic hardship.  And if their needs are not met, they adopt a posture of confrontation with the government. </p>
<p>

<i>Our welfare system has de-capitalized the market system. </i>One serious problem with government welfare benefits is that they de-incentivize the productive members of society and incentivize unproductive members. When easy-money is available, people don’t learn to be hard-working citizens or productive entrepreneurs.  Government should enable the under-privileged to come out of their problems or create new jobs for them, but instead it often acts like a “rich daddy” promising free goods and services. When this happens, it depresses entrepreneurial activity and de-capitalizes the market system. As a result, the incentives present in the market economy get messed up because people are given a monetary incentive to not produce anything.  
</p>
<p>

<i>Our welfare programs have replaced our sense of social responsibility.</i> Today’s Nagas are beginning to forget their social responsibility. In place of each community serving as the social safety net like in the olden days, we have come up with an impersonal system called “the welfare state.” This has resulted in the loss of our social responsibility toward one another.  For example, even people of means are thinking twice about sharing their resources with the less fortunate members in their communities.  Increasingly, the well-to-do are losing their interest in private charity because they presume that government is there to help those in need. This is the resultant tragedy of a welfare state. </p>
<p>

What, then, should we do with welfare programs?  Since the misuse of welfare programs is very easy, the government could introduce a direct cash transfer system (as opposed to in-kind subsidies) and set up immediate cash withdrawal access possible using biometrics, while carefully monitoring the implementation and/or progress of each program. However, it is still doubtful that any top-down bureaucratic management can ever be truly effective and corruption-free. </p>
<p>

So, allow me to suggest two other alternatives which, I believe, can possibly provide a better delivery of welfare services: </p>
<p>

First, we could empower and encourage private charities and churches to fill the need of supplying the “deserving poor” with resources. After all, true religion is to be marked by generosity, especially toward the poor and the needy. Because all religions and most private charity organizations place higher value to selfless services, they can often perform welfare services far more efficiently than the government could ever dream of doing. They are better at guarding against corruption and holding people accountable. If certain welfare recipients are found to be living irresponsibly or squandering funds, private charities can immediately cease giving more free money because they often have stipulations on the funds they give out.  Also, private charities often make sure that the persons they are helping are trying to get out of the problem they are in and will be able to stand on their own feet. Thus, private charities can eliminate problems that are often present in the bureaucratic management of these services. </p>
<p>

The second alternative is this: we can return to our ancestral system of looking after each other, which is the practice of social responsibility. For example, the needy amongst our ancestors were always taken care of by their extended family members or sometimes even by the entire community. Failure to do this was considered a shame for the entire family or community. In other words, they supported each other so that no one—whether young or old, male or female, sick or well---in their community was left behind, deprived, or neglected.  Indeed, they practiced a highly admirable social safety net---a welfare system, as it were---which was spontaneous, voluntary, and personal.  </p>
<p>

Of course, even in returning to the “welfare system” of our ancestors, we would certainly need to improvise many things to keep up with the modern time.  As a first step, for instance, we could upgrade our current village panchayat system to a mini-government system. Then, the state government should take a bottom-up implementation approach by devolving its power to the local level and empowering the various communities to assume charge over the implementation and/or delivery of most of the welfare schemes and public assistance services. This, I believe, is the best way to make the welfare system work as it should be---to maximize help for the under-privileged and empower them to be productive members in the society.  </p>
