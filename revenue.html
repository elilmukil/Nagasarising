<p>
We will introduce various proposals to come up with ways to raise public revenue.  
</p>
<ol class="c">
<li>
	Generating huge savings by eliminating all financial loopholes (frauds, abuses, and wastes) </li></br><li>
	Generating huge savings by stopping all kinds of rampant extortions, unabated taxations, and non-charitable donations </li></br><li>
	Generating huge savings by turning bad debts into good debts</li></br><li>
	Collecting Property Taxes in all urban areas: 
	 <ul class="a"><li>
	All commercial buildings: 2% of its market value each year</li><li>
	All residential houses: 1% of its market value each year</li><li>
	All vacant lands: 1/2% of its market value each year</li></ul></li></br><li>
	Collecting Income Taxes:  <ul class="a"><li>
	All who are within the income bracket of Rs.15 to Rs. 25 lakhs must pay 5% of their total income, and those who make Rs. 25 lakhs or more must pay 8% of their income. In case of government employees, the tax deduction would be made at source â€¦ all in exchange for the privileges, facilities, and infrastructure to be provided by the government.  </li><li>
	All employers/businesses must cut a 5% from the wages of each of their non-local workers and pay the same to the government. </li></ul></li></br>
<li>

	Collecting Corporate/Business Taxes:  All business enterprises making Rs.50 lakhs or more must pay10% of its gross income. But this percentage point on taxes could be reduced depending of the number of jobs created for the local people.

	Generating Earnings through Financial Investments (e.g., FDI), public-private business ventures, etc. </li></br><li>
	Generating Revenue from Mineral/Natural Resources: We will initially tap into the expertise of some foreign companies for oil & mineral exploration at minimum charge </li></br><li>
	Fighting for the Maximum Amount of State-Shares and Central Grants: We will have some top-movers with well-equipped Office in Delhi to manage all fund-raising activities. </li></br></ol>
